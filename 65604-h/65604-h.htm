<p class="ph3">III. PENICUIK HOUSE.</p>


<h2>I.</h2>

<p><span class="smcap">There</span> are few Scottish families that, during the
last two hundred years, have been more closely
connected with the progress of culture in their
native country than the Clerks of Penicuik.</p>

<p>Claiming descent from the Drummonds of Hawthornden,
through Elizabeth Henderson, grand-daughter
of the poet and first wife of the first
Baronet of Penicuik, they have produced, both in
the main line and in its younger branches, a goodly
proportion of men of intellect and mark. At
present we need only name Sir John Clerk, the
second Baronet, one of the Commissioners for the
Union, and a Baron of the Exchequer, a man
of varied attainments and the strongest individuality,
and known as an enthusiastic antiquary;
his son, Sir James, who was the architect
of the present mansion of the family; whose
brother, Sir George Clerk Maxwell, the fourth
Baronet, distinguished himself by his efforts to
promote the commercial interests of his country,
establishing a linen manufactory at Dumfries,
engaging in mining schemes for copper and
lead, and writing much upon agricultural and
industrial subjects; John Clerk of Eldin, younger
brother of the last-named, author of the celebrated
“Essay on Naval Tactics,” and known
as an artist by his series of etchings which
preserve in a manner so interesting to the
antiquary the aspect of many of the historical
edifices of Scotland; his well-known son John
Clerk, “the Coryphæus of the Scottish Bar,”
afterwards Lord Eldin; and the Right Hon. Sir<span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">{4}</span>
George Clerk, sixth Baronet, the friend of Sir
Robert Peel, one of the prominent politicians of
his time, and especially versed in all matters of
statistics. William Aikman, the portrait-painter,
too, was descended from the house of Penicuik,
his mother having been the eldest sister of Sir
John Clerk, the first Baronet; and, in our own
time, Professor James Clerk Maxwell, whose
father was grandson of the fourth Baronet and
brother of the sixth, has by his eminence in science
added new lustre to his parental name.</p>

<p>But not only have the Clerks been themselves
witty—using the word in its best, its old English,
sense—they have been the cause of wit in others;
by their loyal friendships with the best Scottish
painters and poets of their time, and their open-handed
patronage of these men’s work, they have
identified themselves with the history of art and
literature in Scotland. One can hardly pronounce
the name of Allan Ramsay without thinking of
Sir John Clerk of Penicuik, or the name of Alexander
Runciman, without recalling that of Sir
James, his son and successor.</p>

<p>The mansion of the family is situated about a
mile and a half from the village of Penicuik, on a
commanding situation, overlooking the wooded
valley of the Esk, a “classic stream” which, at
this point, is still uncontaminated by the chemicals
of the paper-makers, whose manufactories begin
to appear a little lower, at the village itself.
Manifestly great care and the finest taste have
been expended by the successive owners of the
place in laying out the grounds, which are a
triumph of landscape-gardening, so filled are they
with pleasant combinations of woodland, lawn,
and flowers; and we shall hardly forget their
gorgeous aspect on that summer day when we first
saw them, with their wealth of purple rhododendron
blossoms, and, here and there, a touch of
particularly vivid crimson of beech-leaves diversifying
the “greenery” of June. Especially noticeable
is the skill which has arranged that spaces of
shadowed and closely enclosed foliage shall lead,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_5">{5}</span>
with all the force of sharp and grateful contrast,
to amplest breadth of outlook and extended view;
and so aptly does the peak of the Black Hill top
the belt of trees that bounds the Upper Pond,
and with such a perfect sense of definitely calculated
balance, of satisfying composition, does the
blue outline of Mendick complete the view as we
look up the stream from near the south front of
the house, that, in a fanciful mood, we could well
believe the whole to have been the result of something
more than a mere happy chance,—could
almost imagine that he who designed the place had
been gifted with a wizard’s power, greater than
that of the Prophet himself, that the mountains
had indeed been at his beck and call, that they
had come at his bidding, and taken their stations,
each in the precise spot best fitted to give to the
prospect its last, its crowning perfection.</p>

<p>Nay, Nature herself, even in her moments of
wildest storm, seems to have been working in
harmony with the designer of the place, and
making for its beauty. When you have surveyed
the last-named prospect, and turned a little towards
the left to follow the depressions of the
ground which mark the position of the unseen
bed of the Esk, you note the greensward that
borders the stream; and this leads the eye beyond
to the further bank, where an open space of
clearing among the trees diversifies the succession
of their rounded tops, this break and point of
pause being again repeated further up to the left
among the trees that crest the hill. The last
opening was the work of the tempest, which, by
overturning a trunk or two, disclosed a glimpse of
the distant Peeblesshire moor behind, giving just
that final touch, that hint of the beyond “over
the hills and far away,” which perfects the view,—not
only to the painter, as completing the lines
of its composition, but to the poet as well, by
adding that sense of extended outlook, as of a
vista piercing into the breadth of the world,
which is needful, for finest imaginative effect, in
every landscape.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">{6}</span></p>

<p>Then, too, there are the Penicuik Gardens to
be seen,—the old garden, lying on a sheltered
slope to the south, with its glass-houses, the first,
or all but the very first, of the kind in Scotland;
the extensive modern garden, bounded by brick
walls, the soft mellow colouring of which tells so
pleasantly through the green of the trees; and
especially the “American Garden,” with its
wealth of many-coloured azaleas springing from
the midmost space of softest turf, “a garden
inclosed” like the garden of the Canticles,
cloistered and protected, like some princess of
romance, by thick-set hedges and a circle of
sheltering wood, lest any eager and nipping air
of our northern clime should visit its cheek too
roughly, and blanch the beauty of its ardent
face of flowers.</p>


<h2>II.</h2>

<p>The house, which fronts us as we approach the
termination of the drive, is a modern edifice, built
by Sir James, the third Baronet, in 1761, after he
had returned from a residence in Italy, saturated
with classical ideas. It was erected entirely from
the Baronet’s own designs; but, doubtless, these
were produced under the influence of Robert
Adam, the celebrated architect, whose sister had
been married in 1753 to John Clerk, author of
the “Naval Tactics,” Sir James’s younger brother.
Consequently the present house does not possess
the interest of having been the meeting-place of
Allan Ramsay, who died in 1758, and his friends
and patrons of the Clerk family; an association
erroneously assigned to the present structure by
Dr. Daniel Wilson in his “Reminiscences of Old
Edinburgh,” a work which contains many curious
particulars regarding the Clerks, and especially of
the Baron, the second Baronet. The house in which
the poet and the antiquary spent together many a
genial evening of “honest talk and wholesome
wine” no longer exists. It occupied a site close
behind the present mansion, on whose completion<span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">{7}</span>
it was removed. Some of the old cellars remain
under the earthen mound to the south, and are still
in use. We may sigh a little over the memories
and associations of old Penicuik House, over
the vanished picturesqueness of its “crowstep”
gables and its circular corkscrew turrets, of
which a shadow still survives in the sketch by
John Clerk, reproduced in the Bannatyne Club
issue of his etchings; but doubtless the present
mansion is vastly more commodious and in better
harmony with modern ideas of comfort than was
its predecessor, and it takes its place excellently in
the landscape; its effect not greatly marred by
the more recent wings added by Bryce in 1857-8;
its straight perpendicular and horizontal lines
contrasting excellently with the flowing curves of
ground and trees, in that fashion which Turner
recognised and loved, and emphasised so delightfully
in his early drawings of four-square English
mansions set amid the rounded forms of wood
and hill and stream.</p>

<p>As we turn our eye towards the offices of
Penicuik House, which are situated a little to
our right, two objects of rather singular aspect
arrest our attention. Regarding one of them—a
tall, very ecclesiastical-looking steeple garnished
with the usual large gilded clock-face, which in
the oddest fashion surmounts the stables—a
curious bit of tradition lingers in the neighbourhood.
It seems that Sir James designed not
only his own mansion, but also the parish church
of Penicuik. When the plan of the latter, however,
was submitted to the heritors or kirk-session,
it appears that they would have none of
the steeple,—for what reason is not recorded,
whether it was that their architectural tastes did
not chime in with those of the Baronet, or that
they considered it as too decorative a feature to
be in accordance with severe Presbyterian principles,
or whether, finally, the expense was too
great for their pockets. Declined, at any rate, the
steeple was, so local tradition affirms. But Sir
James was by no means willing that the structure<span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">{8}</span>
which his brain had devised should only be
dimly visible upon paper, and never take substantial
embodiment in stone and lime; so he
reared it, at his own proper cost, in his stable-yard,
where it still forms so imposing and unusual
a feature.</p>

<p>The other curious erection is a rounded dome
on the opposite side of the court, raising its
height above the stable buildings. This is nothing
less than an accurate reproduction of “Arthur’s
O’on,” which formerly existed on the north bank
of the Carron, a mile and a half from Falkirk,
believed by “Sandy Gordon,” the great antiquarian
friend of the second Baronet of Penicuik,
to be a Roman <i>Sacellum</i>, or chapel in which
military standards and insignia were deposited,
and fully described and discussed in his “Itinerarium
Septentrionale,” that precious folio which
Oldbuck had captured and was beginning to
examine when we make his acquaintance in the
opening chapters of “The Antiquary.”</p>

<p>Turning, however, to the house itself, we may
remark, as we enter, that the ornaments of the
front—the stone vases that break the sky-line,
and the graceful “Chippendale” shield of arms,
furnished with the decorative, not heraldic,
adjunct of wings—were designed by John Clerk
of Eldin, author of the “Naval Tactics,” a cadet
of the family. Also that the <i>grisaille</i> painting on
the lower side of the roof of the raised portico
was executed—so James Jackson’s “Account of
the Parish of Penicuik” informs us—by Alexander
Runciman, when he was an apprentice with John
Norie, the well-known decorative painter and landscapist
of Edinburgh, and that it was the ability
displayed in this work that induced Sir James
to assist in sending the youth for four or five
years to Rome, whence he returned to execute
the mural paintings of the St. Margaret Staircase
and the Ossian Hall of Penicuik House. The
motto, from Cicero’s <i>De Officiis</i> with which the
portal is inscribed, was chosen by the Earl of
Perth, grandson of John Drummond, the attainted<span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">{9}</span>
Earl of Melfort, a close friend of Sir James’s;
and a letter regarding it may be transcribed, as
a quaint example of the stately epistles of our
ancestors.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“<span class="smcap">Sir</span>,—Upon considering the manner of your
House of Pennicueik, where I had the pleasure
of beeing some days in November last, and admiring
the Architecture of it, after 40 years ponderating

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0"><i>Non Domo Dominus, sed Domino Domus honestanda est,</i></div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>found for the first time that it was obtemperate,
and should wish for leave to inscribe it on Pennicueik
House as the real sentiment of</p>

<p>
<span class="ml4">Your most obedient</span><br />

<p>“<i><span class="smcap">Lundin House</span>, Ap. 22, 1771.</i>”</p>
</div>


<h2>III.</h2>

<p>In the Entrance Hall various antiquarian and
artistic treasures decorate the walls or are preserved
in glass cases,—the colours of the local
volunteer regiment that was raised at the time of
the French Invasion scare, full-sized marble copies
of various antique statues, excellent old china,
several fine missals, the fan and necklace of Mary
Queen of Scots, said to have come into the Clerk
family from Mary Gray, wife of the first John Clerk
of Penicuik, through her mother, Mary Gillies,
to whom it was given before the execution at
Fotheringay, and the gold snuff-box presented by
the Scottish Widows’ Fund to Lord Eldin, in
1825, in recognition of his services at the time
of the foundation of the company.</p>


<h2>IV.</h2>

<p>Turning to the right from the Hall we enter
the Dining-room, where the most important of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">{10}</span>
the portraits are hung. But here the places of
honour on the walls, above the fireplaces and
fronting the long line of windows which light the
apartment, are occupied by no family portraits,
by no effigies of distinguished heads of the house.
Even the portrait of the second Baronet, the
potent Baron of Exchequer himself, even the
great Raeburn group of the fifth Baronet and his
comely wife, Mary Dacre, have been waived to
less important positions; and the pictures which
hold the chief places represent a poet and a
painter who were loved and honoured by this
family of Penicuik.</p>

<p>Over the fireplace to the right is an excellent
portrait, by William Aikman, of Allan Ramsay
the elder, a man who, though his verses may
seem a little artificial and a little dull to the
readers of our own day, is worthy of all honour,
not only for having aided in turning Scottish
poetry into a freer and more natural channel, but
also for having established a theatre and the first
circulating library in Edinburgh, and so distinctly
served the cause of culture in Scotland.
He was the sworn friend of the house of Penicuik,
the chosen associate of the second Baronet,
and of his son, afterwards Sir James, whom he
addresses in that homely and vigorous “Epistle,”
beginning—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Blythe may he be who o’er the haugh,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">All free from care, may sing and laugh,”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>which is dated “Pennycuick, May 9, 1755.”</p>

<p>The present picture, very similar to that which
was excellently mezzotinted by George White,
shows the poet nearly to the waist, clad in a
brown coat, the shirt open at the throat and
without a cravat. No wig is worn, but the
head is wound round tightly, cap-fashion, with
a low-toned orange handkerchief, beneath which
appears the bright, alert, intelligent face, with its
bushy eyebrows and very black eyes, its wide-nostrilled,
humorous, slightly <i>retroussé</i> nose, and
its large-lipped mouth, full and rippling over<span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">{11}</span>
with good-nature and sensitiveness. We are
enabled to fix the exact date of the picture by
means of the following interesting inscription on
the back, in the autograph of Sir John, the
second Baronet:—</p>


<p class="center p2">“A Roundlet in Mr. Ramsay’s own Way.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Here painted on this canvass clout,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">By Aikman’s hand is Ramsay’s snout,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The picture’s value none might doubt,</div>
    <div class="verse indent4">For ten to one I’ll venture,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The greatest criticks could not tell</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Which of the two does most excell,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Or in his way should bear the bell,</div>
    <div class="verse indent4">The Poet or the Painter.</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse right">J. C. Pennicuik, 5 May 1723.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The picture accordingly represents the poet in
his thirty-seventh year, and was painted when
the artist was about to leave Scotland to settle
in London, an occasion on which Ramsay inscribed
to him his “Pastoral Farewell,”—not his
only poetical tribute to his friend, for previously,
in 1721, he had penned another “Epistle,” in
which he thanks the portraitist because</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“By your assistance unconstrain’d,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">To courts I can repair,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And by your art my way I’ve gained</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">To closets of the fair.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>There are many other portraits which enable
us to gather what was the personal appearance
of the author of “The Gentle Shepherd.” There
is the print in which the poet appears in all the
bright bravery of youth, clad in a kind of
fanciful Scottish costume,—a coat slashed at
the sleeves, a plaid laid over his right shoulder,
a broad Highland bonnet, with a St. Andrew
badge, set on the head. This is the frontispiece
to the first quarto edition of his works, published
by Ruddiman in 1721: it is engraved by T.
Vereruysse, and bears the initials J. S. P., which,
as we learn from the engraving by Vertue, evidently
from the same picture, in Ramsay’s
“Poems and Songs,” 1728, stands for “John<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">{12}</span>
Smibert, Pinxit.” This painter, born in Edinburgh
in 1684, was a friend and correspondent of
Ramsay’s, and it was to him, while studying art
in Italy, that the poet addressed that “Epistle to
a Friend in Florence” which is included in his
works. He accompanied Bishop Berkeley to
Rhode Island in 1727, and afterwards settled in
Boston, where he resided till his death in 1751.
In Britain his works are scarce, but a portrait
of Berkeley by his hand is in the National
Portrait Gallery, London, and there is at Monymusk,
Aberdeenshire, along with minor examples
of his art, an important group of Lord Cullen
and his family, including twelve life-sized figures,
which he painted in 1720. Smibert is believed
to have executed a second portrait of Allan
Ramsay, that kit-cat likeness with the head
turned nearly in profile to the left, which formed
the frontispiece to “The Gentle Shepherd, with
Illustrations of the Scenery,” Edinburgh 1814,
engraved by A. Wilson, from a drawing made by
A. Carse from the picture (now at New Hall, Mid-Lothian),
which had belonged to the poet himself,
and afterwards to Janet Ramsay, a daughter who
survived him.</p>

<p>Again there is a singularly heavy-looking and
spiritless portrait engraved in the second volume
of Ruddiman’s 1728 edition of Ramsay’s works,
marked as by Strange’s master, “R. Cooper, ad
vivum sculpsit, Edin<sup>r</sup>,” showing the figure to the
waist, the right hand holding a volume of the
Poems; and the smaller print, without name of
painter or engraver, which seems to be an improved
adaptation of this portrait, the face
become refined and delicate, a fitting face for a
poet.</p>

<p>There is, further, that interesting and characteristic
chalk drawing, by the poet’s artist son,
preserved at Woodhouselee, and inscribed “His
first attempt of that kind from the life ... 1729,”
done when the youth—who in the words of his
father in a letter to the above-mentioned Smibert,
had “been pursuing his science since he was a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">{13}</span>
dozen years auld”—was just sixteen, seven years
before he started for Italy, to study art in Rome;
and there is a print in which the same portrait is
treated as a bust on a pedestal, drawn by the
younger Ramsay and engraved by Cooper. There
is also the well-known portrait, done by the same
filial hand, that was engraved by David Allan in
the 1788 quarto edition of “The Gentle Shepherd,”
a bust likeness, with the strong-featured, firmly
modelled face turned in profile to the right,
appearing from behind a parapet on which lie
the various symbols of the pastoral muse, a mask,
a staff, a crook, and a rustic pipe. In interest,
however, and in all life-like qualities, the picture
at Penicuik is fully equal to the best of those we
have named as portraying the shrewd and cheerful
countenance of the homely poet.</p>

<p>The portrait which hangs to the left, over the
other fireplace of the Penicuik Dining-room is also
by Aikman, and its subject is the painter himself.
Here again an additional interest is given to the
picture, in this case a most pathetic interest, by
its inscription. On its back is a note, also in the
hand of the second Baronet of Penicuik, the
painter’s cousin:—“Mr. Aikman, painted by
himself when dying, and left as a legacy to me,
J. C., anno 1733.”</p>

<p>This artist was born in 1682, the son of William
Aikman of Cairnie, Forfarshire, by his second wife,
Margaret, sister of the first Sir John Clerk. In
his youth he was possessed, as Douglas of the
Baronage says, with even more than his customary
solemnity, of a “mighty genius for portrait-painting.”
His father, like so many of the Scottish
gentry, was a member of the Scottish Bar, and desired
that his son should enter upon the studies
that would qualify him for the same profession—studies
which would reasonably occupy his time,
put him in the way of intellectual effort, and give
him enough law to enable him to manage his
estates profitably, and to sit with dignity and propriety
upon the bench of county magistrates.
But the parental wishes were in vain; the “mighty<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">{14}</span>
genius for portrait-painting” was not to be controlled.
Aikman studied art for three years in
Edinburgh, under Sir John de Medina, of whose
portraiture there is a representative series in Penicuik
House; and, when he came into possession
of his ancestral acres, which were valuable then,
and have become doubly valuable since, he
promptly parted with them, sold all that he
had for the sake of art; and having rid himself of
the burden of ponderable and engrossing material
things, started a free man to study painting in
Rome. During the five years that he spent abroad
he even visited Constantinople and Smyrna, a “far
cry” indeed for a Scottish laird of the beginning
of the seventeenth century. Returning to his
native country in 1712, he was in time patronised
by John, Duke of Argyll, and in 1723 he established
himself in London, where he moved in the
best and most cultured circles, numbering among
his friends Sir Robert Walpole, Pope, Swift,
Arbuthnot, and Gay, several of whom still live
upon his canvases. At the age of forty-nine he was
prosperous and happy, in excellent practice as a
portrait-painter, busied upon a great group of the
Royal Family, commissioned by the Earl of Burlington,
and now in the possession of the Duke of
Devonshire. But this work was destined never
to be completed. His only son, one of those
“bonnie bairns” to whom Allan Ramsay refers in
his “Pastoral Farewell to Mr. Aikman,” a youth
of great artistic promise—several etched studies
after Van Dyck by his hand still exist to prove his
talent<a id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a>—sickened and died at the age of eighteen,
and the father never recovered the blow. He
pined away, died six months afterwards, 1731, and
was buried in the same grave in the Greyfriars’
Churchyard, Edinburgh. Mallet wrote his epitaph;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">{15}</span>
Ramsay, Thomson, and Somerville have
recorded his virtues and the charm of his presence.</p>

<p>At Penicuik we are enabled to trace the development
of Aikman’s art from first to final phase.
His portrait of “Dame Christina Kilpatrick,”
second wife of the first Baronet, is marked on the
back by the painter’s cousin, “painted 1706 by
Mr. Aikman when he was learning to paint, but
very like.” The portrait of the second Baronet
himself, similarly inscribed, “painted by Mr.
Aikman, about the year 1706, when he was beginning
to paint,” is identical in style with the
work of his master Medina. In the Red Bedroom
are hung his school copies after classical
subjects by Maratti, done at Rome; and we have
seen that the portrait of himself was one of the
very last canvases that his brush touched.</p>

<p>This portrait of Aikman showing the figure
nearly to the waist within a painted oval, is practically
identical with that in the National Gallery
of Scotland, formerly in the possession of Mrs.
Forbes, the artist’s eldest daughter, and engraved
in “The Bee,” vol. xviii. 1793. The only difference
is that here the draperies consist of a coat
and vest of a cool yellowish-brown velvet, passing
into definite yellow in the high lights, while in
the National Gallery version a golden-brown gown
and a flowered vest of the same colour is substituted.
The well-balanced, handsome, oval face,
with its ripe mouth, rippling in its lines and
dimpled at the corners, fine dark-blue eyes, and
rounded, slightly cleft chin, is turned in three-quarters
towards the right, and surmounted by a
voluminous powdered wig. Another portrait of
Aikman by himself is preserved at Florence in the
Painters’ Gallery of the Uffizi. Here the pose of
the figure is similar to that in the two other
pictures; but the coat is of crimson, the lower part
of the body is wrapped in a dark mantle, and no
wig is worn, its place being taken by a white
handkerchief which is wound round the head.
Among the portraits of Aikman at The Ross is
another from his own hand, showing him as he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">{16}</span>
appeared on his travels, bearded, and wearing a
turban and a ruddy Eastern gown.</p>

<p>We may now turn to the family portraits with
which the walls of the Dining-room are covered.
The earliest of them is a portrait of John Clerk,
father of the first Baronet, and the founder of the
family, known for centuries in the familiar traditions
of the Penicuik nursery under the playful
title of “Musso,” from his prolonged residence in
France. He was born in 1610, the son of a
merchant-burgess of Montrose, and baptized at
Fettercairn by the Bishop of Caithness, on the
22d December of that year. Bred a merchant,
he settled in Paris in 1634, where he acquired “a
fortune of at least £10,000,” as his grandson
informs us. In 1647 he returned to Scotland,
married, acquired the lands of Penicuik and of
Wrightshouses, near Edinburgh, and died in 1674,
at the age of sixty-three.</p>

<p>His portrait, which hangs in the Dining-room,
is not a contemporary work, but a copy executed
by Aikman—to range with the other family
pictures—from a miniature, done in Paris by an
unknown painter, and still preserved in the
Charter-room. This original, inscribed on its
gold case “John Clerk of Pennicuik, 1644,” is a
bust portrait painted in oils on a small oval slab
of bloodstone, the polished green surface of which,
with its red markings, serves for background.
The face shows a delicate, prominently aquiline
nose, a forehead broad rather than high, sharply
pencilled black eyebrows above the dark blue
eyes, a full, brightly red lower lip, a small
moustache of darkest brown, turned up at the
ends, and a tiny tuft on the chin. The bust is
clad in that pseudo-Roman costume so much
affected in the portraiture of the period, similar to
that in which Charles <span class="allsmcap">II.</span> appears in the equestrian
statue in the Parliament Square, Edinburgh, and
very closely resembling the dress worn by George
Lauder, author of “The Scottish Souldier,” in the
scarce portrait engraved by J. Hermanni after
J. Reyners. The tunic is of a bright blue colour,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">{17}</span>
cut square at the neck, and edged with gold lace,
decorated on the breast and shoulders with gold
ornaments worked into the shape of satyr and
lion heads, and a bright red mantle falls in graceful
folds on either side. The little picture is of
excellent workmanship and is delicately finished,
much of its precision of detail having been lost in
Aikman’s not very refined life-sized copy.</p>

<p>Above the fireplace in the Drawing-room is
another portrait of this same John Clerk, a large,
dark, gallery full-length, stated to have been
executed, like the miniature, in Paris. Here the
founder of the family is depicted standing, in a
black dress, his right hand resting on the stone
ball which surmounts and decorates the parapet of
garden walk, his left hand sustaining his sword.
The countenance is manifestly the same as that
in the miniature. This picture is stated by family
tradition to have been painted by “De Wit,” a
portrait-painter we have not as yet been able to
identify. It bears no resemblance in style to the
portraits executed by James de Witt at Holyrood
in 1684-5, and at Glamis Castle in 1686-8;
and it could hardly have been the same artist
who was working at Paris before the year 1647.
Nor, of course, is it by Jacob de Wit, the painter
of a subject in the Library to be afterwards
described, who was not born till 1695.</p>

<p>The portrait of the wife of John Clerk, Mary,
daughter of Sir William Gray of Pittendrum, is
also a copy, and of this a delicate and spirited
contemporary miniature is preserved at Penicuik.
It was executed about the end of the last century
by Miss Ann Forbes, a grand-daughter of William
Aikman’s, and consequently a connection of the
Clerks, whose work, chiefly in crayons, though
this is an oil picture, is to be found in many
Scottish houses, as, for instance, at The Ross,
Hamilton, the seat of the present head of Aikman’s
family. A few other examples of her brush are
preserved in the present collection; and her
own portrait, painted by David Allan, a carefully
handled cabinet picture, very clear and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">{18}</span>
silvery in tone, showing her standing in three-quarters
length, holding a portcrayon and a portfolio,
is in the Scottish National Portrait Gallery.
The portrait of Mrs. Mary Clerk, like that of her
husband, shows the figure to the waist; the face is
in three-quarters to the right. She has light
hazel eyes, neutral brown eyebrows and hair, the
latter elaborately curled, fastened with bows of
black ribbon, and decorated in front with a small
plume of white ostrich feathers, and she wears
pearl ear-rings and a double string of large pearls
round the neck. The costume is a black flowered
dress, worn low at the breast, with a tall white
lace collar standing up behind the neck.</p>


<h2>V.</h2>

<p>We come now to examine the portraits of Sir
John Clerk, the first Baronet of Penicuik, who
was born in 1649; served repeatedly in Parliament,
after the Revolution of 1688, as member for
the county of Edinburgh; was Lieutenant-Colonel
of a regiment commanded by the Earl of Lauderdale;
was created a Baronet by Charles <span class="allsmcap">II.</span> in
1679; acquired the lands of Lasswade in 1700;
and died in 1722. He is described by his son as
“one of the strongest men of his time, but not
full in stature, being scarce 5 feet 6 inches,”
“finely made, had proportionate breadth, and a
Hercules shoulders,” “a man of knowledge and
application,” “a pretty good scholar, and exceedingly
knowing in Divinity.”</p>

<p>No fewer than five portraits—pictures and
miniatures—at Penicuik are stated to represent
this first Baronet. The earliest is that preserved
in the glass case beside the entrance to the
Library. It is a miniature, executed on paper
with the brush and Indian ink, showing a small
head, turned in three-quarters to the left, and
garnished with a long wig. On the back is inscribed,
in the handwriting of the Chief Baron,
the first Baronet’s son, “Sir John Clerk then in
those days in London a counselar at Law great<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">{19}</span>
wigs were in fashion 1689.” In the same case
is a second miniature of similar general character,
but drawn upon vellum, accompanied by a companion
miniature of the first Baronet’s second
wife, Christian, daughter of the Rev. Mr. Kilpatrick.
Another portrait of this lady, an oil-portrait,
showing the figure to the waist, is in the
Dining-room. Here she wears a claret-coloured
dress and an amber-brown mantle. The hair is
yellowish brown, the eyes of a dark rich brown, and
the face, which is a little out of drawing, though
curiously individual and life-like, has peculiarly
raised eyebrows. This work is inscribed in the
handwriting of her son-in-law—“Dame Christian
Kilpatrick, my father’s second wife, painted 1706
by Mr. Aikman, when he was learning to paint,
but very like”—an early example of the artist,
done when he was studying under Medina, the
year before he left for Italy.</p>

<p>In the Dining-room are three other works, all
life-sized oil-portraits, stated to be likenesses of
the first Baronet. One of them, showing Sir John
clad in a brown gown lined with red, is manifestly
a companion portrait done at the same
time as the last-named portrait of his wife. It
also bears a similar note by the Baron—“My
father Sir John Clerk, painted by Mr. Aikman
about the year 1706, when he was beginning to
paint.” In its style of handling, as well as in its
combinations of colour, it recalls most strongly
the works of Sir John Medina, its painter’s
master.</p>

<p>A second portrait is also by Aikman, a later
and more accomplished work. Here the figure is
seen nearly to the waist, turned to the right, with
the face slightly in the same direction. A curled
wig is worn, and a single-breasted coat of pale blue
velvet. The eyes are of a clear blue colour; and
the face is of that firm, powerful, large-featured
type which for generations was habitual in the
house of Penicuik. This picture, again, is inscribed
in the son’s handwriting—“Sir John
Clerk of Pennicuik, my Father, painted by Mr.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">{20}</span>
Aikman. He was born in April 1649, and died in
March 1722, aged 73.”</p>

<p>Very considerable difficulty attaches to the
remaining portrait, which is believed to represent
the first Sir John Clerk, and to the manifestly
companion portrait beside it, which has been held
to portray his first wife, Elizabeth, daughter of
Henry Henderson of Elvington, and grand-daughter
of William Drummond of Hawthornden,
a poet “of an excellent Fancy for the times he
lived in,” as the Baron remarks, rather patronisingly,
in the family history with which he begins
his account of his own life.</p>

<p>It has been stated (Catalogue of National
Gallery of Scotland, 1887) that these portraits
“are dated 1674.” This, however, is inaccurate,
as no inscription appears upon either work. It
has also been asserted (Catalogue of Royal Scottish
Academy Loan Exhibition of 1863) that “the
original Scougal accounts for the price paid for
them” are preserved at Penicuik; but a search
which we have made through the old receipts of
the period has failed to disclose such a document.
Probably this second reference is not to the
painter’s receipt, but simply to an entry of the
payment which is to be found in an interesting
old account-book preserved in the Charter-room
at Penicuik, one of that “great many journals
and writings” which the Chief Baron records that
his father left “under his hand, which will, I hope,
bear testimony to the regard he always had for
virtue and Honesty.” This volume the Chief
Baron—partly in filial piety, more perhaps with
the instinct of the accurate and omnivorous antiquary—has
docketed as follows: “Book of
Accompts by my Grandfather Mr. Jo. Clerk, and
Father Sir John Clerk, Whereon are several
things remarkable. 1<sup>o</sup>, their methodes of accompting.
2<sup>o</sup>, their methodes of management. 3<sup>o</sup>, the
different prices of things. John Clerk, 1733.”
Here on a page <i>headed June 1674</i>, but under
date of “Nov<sup>r</sup> 1675,” the following entry appears—“To
John Scougall for 2 pictures £36”; and it<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">{21}</span>
is curious, as illustrating “the different prices of
things,” and also as showing how a love of all
the various fine arts prevailed then among the
Clerks, as it has prevailed among them ever since,
to note another entry, which appears a few lines
beneath: “To Mr. Chambers for Teaching G.
and me to play y<sup>e</sup> violl £150,” both sums being in
Scots currency.</p>

<p>There can be no doubt that the portraits above
referred to are the “2 pictures” by Scougall
mentioned in the account-book, for a comparison
with other works by that painter proves them to
be excellent and most typical examples of his
brush, and there are no other pictures in the
house painted in a style recalling that artist,
except the portrait of Lord Justice-Clerk Sir
Archibald Primrose, which will be afterwards
referred to. It has been assumed, but on less
sufficient evidence, that they represent the first
Sir John Clerk (by whom they were certainly
commissioned) and his first wife, and that they
were painted to celebrate the wedding of the pair,
which occurred in 1674. It is to be noted, however,
that the account-book gives no information
as to who the personages are that appear in the
pictures; that there is no contemporary inscriptions
on the works themselves to prove that it is
the first Baronet and his wife that are portrayed
and not merely two of their friends; that in the
male portrait the face is delicate in its curves and
contours, with a long thin nose, drooping at the
point, quite unlike the countenance which appears
in the pictures certified in the handwriting of
the son as representing the first Baronet; and
that the present picture seems to portray a man
of more than twenty-five or twenty-six, the age
of the first Sir John when the work was executed.</p>

<p>But, whomever they portray, the pictures are
excellent and interesting examples of a little-known
Scottish artist, by far the finest works by
John Scougall with which we are acquainted;
and they afford most interesting representations<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">{22}</span>
of the costume of the end of the seventeenth
century.</p>

<p>Each of them shows its subject to the waist.
The male figure is turned to the right, clad in a
black doublet, with richly wrought silver buttons,
partly open in front and disclosing the shirt,
which also appears at the arms, beneath the short
sleeves of the coat; and the short embroidered
cravat is drawn through a loop and spread out, in
fan-like folds, on either side. The thin, nervous-looking
face wears a very peculiar expression; the
eyes dark blue, the long yellowish hair curling
down to the shoulders: it is a face eminently
individual, utterly unforgetable.</p>

<p>The lady’s portrait is even a more beautiful
and fascinating old picture. Here the figure is
turned to the left; the face, seen in three-quarters,
is rather pallid in its flesh-tints, as was usual with
the painter, a characteristic which appears also
in the male portrait. The eyes are of a neutral
grey-blue; the yellow-brown hair is worn flat on
the top, and bound with a string of pearls, from
beneath which it flows in carefully arranged
ringlets. The dress, of plain white satin, with
voluminous sleeves, is cleverly handled and excellently
expressive of the texture and sheen of
the material; and a brooch of pearls and dark
stones is set at the breast, clasping a scarf of
faint blending blue and yellow tints, which floats
over the lady’s right shoulder, and flows freely
behind.</p>

<p>Of James Clerk of Wrightshouses, the second
son of the first John Clerk of Penicuik, and
brother of the first Baronet, we have an imposing
three-quarters length painted by Sir Peter Lely.
He appears standing, robed in a rich crimson
gown, which shows its orange-tinted lining, with
an elaborate lace cravat, and ruffles appearing at
the hands, one of which is laid gracefully against
his side, while his right arm rests on a stone
parapet to the left. The face is of a man of
between thirty and forty, with handsome regular
features and the rounded, oval cheeks and small,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">{23}</span>
ripe, red-lipped mouth which the painter loved
to depict, and with much individuality and
character in the firm clear-cut line of the nose. A
dark curtain appears behind the figure, and a low-toned,
wintry-looking distance of landscape.</p>

<p>The companion picture of Mary Ricard, “a
French lady,” wife of James Clerk of Wrightshouses,
also shows the figure standing and in
three-quarters length. She is clad in a low-breasted,
short-sleeved dress, richly brocaded
with crimson, yellow, and green flowers, and with
a simple string of large pearls round the neck.
She has brown eyes, light brown eyebrows,
moderately arched, and dark brown curling hair,
one curl lying isolated on her white shoulder.
She is arranging flowers in a yellow brown pot
decorated with Cupids’ heads, which stands on a
table to the left, and behind the figure is a wall
with a pilaster, a red curtain, and a glimpse of
landscape with blue mountain peaks, which may
very well be the southern slope of the familiar
Pentlands as seen from Penicuik House.</p>


<h2>VI.</h2>

<p>Of the first Baronet’s eldest son, Sir John
Clerk, second Baronet, and one of the Barons of
Exchequer, several portraits are preserved at
Penicuik; but even a more complete picture of
this stout old gentleman, perhaps the most potent
and memorable figure that appears in this family
history, may be gathered from the voluminous
diaries in his hand that are preserved in the
Charter-room, and from that “History of my Life,”
which he himself compiled from these, and which
the present Baronet has placed at the disposal of
the Scottish History Society for publication; a
manuscript affording a clear narrative of the events
of the Baron’s life, and throwing curious and
valuable side-lights upon the manners and public
occurrences of the time, while, in almost every
line of its pages, it gives a vivid, if unconscious,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">{24}</span>
picture of the quaint, masterful personality of its
writer.</p>

<p>He was born, as he tells us, on the 8th of
February 1676—not in 1684, as stated by his
biographers; studied at Penicuik School and
Glasgow University; and, at the age of nineteen,
went to Leyden to be instructed in law by “a very
learned man, Philippus Bernardus Vitrianus.”
Here he boarded with a German who taught
mathematics, philosophy, and music, and he
applied himself to all of these studies as well as
to law, having previously, as he remarks with
proper pride, “played tolerably on the harpsicord,
and since I was 7 I touched the violin a
little.” Nor do these exhaust the list of his
pursuits, for “among other things I learned to
draw from Francis Miers, a very great painter;
this proceeded partly from inclination, and partly
from the advice I had from some of my Dutch
friends, for all their young Folks learn to draw
from their being 7 years of Age, and find it
vastly useful in most Stations of Life.” His great
friend at Leyden was Herman Boerhaave, then a
man of twenty-six, afterwards world-famous as
a physician, and he gives a curious account of
his being treated by the young doctor with a
“chymecal medicine he had discovered which
would carry off the smallpox before they came
any length,” and which was successful at the
time, though the malady returned in full force
three months afterwards, when Clerk had gone
to Rome. “We not only lived like brothers while
I studied in Leyden, but continued a correspondence
together while he lived”; and forty-four
years afterwards Boerhaave bequeathed to
the Baron a collection of his books, which still
forms part of the Library at Penicuik House.</p>

<p>After leaving Leyden Clerk visited Germany,
Italy, France, and Flanders, and the two large
<span class="allsmcap">MS.</span> volumes of his “Travels” during this period—not
only descriptive of the various places that he
saw, and very particularly of the antiquities of
Rome, but also giving an account of the laws<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">{25}</span>
manners, and customs of the several countries
that he visited—prove how diligent and observant
the youth had been during the whole time. At
the end of these volumes he sums up the results
of his residence abroad, as follows:—</p>

<p>“<i>N.B.</i>—My improvements abroad were these:</p>

<p>“I had studied the civil Law for three Winters
at Leyden, and did not neglect it at home, by
which means I passed Advocate, by a privat and
publick examination some months after my return,
with great ease and some credite.</p>

<p>“I spoke French and Italian very well, but particularly
Dutch, having come very young into
Holland, and kept more in the Company of Hollanders
than those of my own country.</p>

<p>“I had applied much to classical learning, and
had more than ordinary inclination for Greek and
Roman Antiquities.</p>

<p>“I understood pictures better than became my
Purse, and as to Musick I ... performed better,
especially on the Herpsicord, than became a
gentleman.</p>

<p>“This, to the best of my knowledge, is a faithful
account of myself.”</p>

<p>The volumes are illustrated with over fifty
drawings of the landscapes, buildings, statues,
etc., which he had seen during his travels, “a few
of many hundreds executed while I was abroad.”</p>

<p>In 1702 he was elected member for Whithorn
in Galloway, which he represented till 1707; and
his “History” contains curious particulars of the
last sittings of the Scottish Parliament, and personal
references to the prominent political figures
of the period,—to the Duke of Queensberry, the
Duke of Argyll, the Marquis of Tweeddale, the
Earl of Stair, Robert Dundas, second Lord
Arniston, and Fletcher of Salton—“a man of
republican principles,” “a little untoward in
temper, and much inclined to Eloquence.” In
1706-7, through the influence of the Duke of
Queensberry, his first wife’s cousin, and the Duke
of Argyll, he was appointed a Commissioner for
the Union; and in the following year he became<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">{26}</span>
one of the Barons of the newly constituted Court
of Exchequer in Scotland.</p>

<p>From this period till his death on the 4th of
October 1755, his life was occupied with his
official duties; with planting and improving his
various estates; with the classical studies to
which he continued faithful all his days; with
the composition of various learned pamphlets,
several of which have been published—his “Historical
View of the Forms and Powers of the
Court of Exchequer in Scotland,” written in conjunction
with Baron Scrope, having been edited
by Sir Henry Jardine in 1820; in the enjoyment
of the society of his friend Allan Ramsay, the
poet; and in correspondence with Roger Gale,
and with Alexander Gordon, in the subscription
list of whose “Itinerarium Septentrionale” he is
entered for “five books,” in company with such
well-known names as “Mr. Adams, Architect”;
“The Right Hon. Duncan Forbes, Lord Advocate
of Scotland”; “James Gibbs, Esq., Architect”;
“The Right Hon. The Lord Lovat”; “Richard
Mead, M.D.”; “The Hon. Sir Hans Sloane,
Bart.”; and “Mr. John Smibert,” the portrait-painter.
Gordon styles him “not only a treasure
of learning and good taste, but now one of its
chief supports in that country,” and pronounces
that “among all the collections of Roman antiquities
in Scotland, that of Baron Clerk claims
the preference, both as to number and curiosity.”
It was one of the Baron’s antiquarian experiences
at a supposed Roman camp on his property
of Dumcrieff, in Dumfriesshire, which, narrated
to Scott by his son, John Clerk of Eldin, suggested
the episode of the “Prætorium” in “The
Antiquary.”</p>

<p>Occasionally across the quiet and characteristic
pages that narrate his daily doings there falls the
shadow of larger national events: of the Rebellion
of 1715,—“The Earl of Mar was not
only my acquaintance but my particular friend”;
of the South Sea Scheme, in connection with
which Clerk held stock, and was a consequent<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">{27}</span>
sufferer; and of the Rebellion of 1745, when the
Highlanders in occupation of Edinburgh visited
Penicuik House, demanding food and drink.</p>

<p>As a poet—or, at least, a rhymester—the Baron
is known by the really vigorous verses which he
added to the single surviving stanza of the old
Scotch song</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“O merry may the maid be</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">That marries the miller,”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>which will be found in Johnston’s “Musical
Museum,” but were first published anonymously,
in 1751, in “The Charmer”; and by the lines
beginning</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Harmonious pipe, how I envye thy bliss</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">When pressed to Sylphia’s lips with gentle kiss,”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>which he sent, screwed up in a flute to Susanna
Kennedy, afterwards the celebrated Countess of
Eglintoune, to whom Allan Ramsay dedicated his
“Gentle Shepherd,” and of whom Clerk was a lover
in his youth, at the time when, as he tells us, he
suffered from his father’s “attempts” to find him
a wife, and especially to wed him to a lady—whose
name he honourably suppresses—“not to
my taste, and indeed it was happy for me to have
stopt short in this amour, for she proved the most
disagreeable woman I ever knew, tho’ otherways
a wise enough country woman.” There
also exist in <span class="allsmcap">MS.</span> “Some Poetical Ejeculations
on the Death of my dear wife, Lady Margaret
Stuart,” that “choice of my own,” who became
his first wife, “a very handsome woman, for the
most part bred up in Galloway, a stranger to the
follies of Edinburgh,” “the best Woman that ever
breathed Life.”</p>

<p>The earliest of the portraits of the Baron preserved
at Penicuik House hangs in the dressing-room
of the present Baronet. It is a small, carefully
finished pencil-drawing; an interesting memorial
of Sir John’s student days at Leyden. The figure
is portrayed to the waist, clad in a loose gown, and
with a voluminous cravat wrapped round the neck.
The hands are not shown. The hair is long and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">{28}</span>
curling. The face full, beardless, and youthful,
set in three-quarters to the right, is modelled
with excellent thoroughness, and very crisp and
incisive in the touches that express the lips and
the dimple at the corner of the mouth. The
background is dark to the left, and to the right
appears a wall decorated with pilasters. The
drawing is inscribed on the background “Ætatis
19,” and beneath “My picture done at Leyden,
Jo. Clerk”; while on the back is written “My
picture done at Leyden by Francis Miris,” the
two latter inscriptions being in the handwriting
of the Baron himself.</p>

<p>A comparison of the dates leads to some
dubiety as to who was the actual draughtsman of
this portrait. There were three well-known
Dutch painters of the name of Mieris—Frans
Van Mieris, the pupil of Gerard Dow, born at
Delft in 1635, died at Leyden 1681; Willem Van
Mieris, his son, born at Leyden 1662, and died
there, 1747; and his son, Frans Van Mieris,
the younger, born at Leyden 1689, died there
in 1763. The year in which the drawing was
executed must have been 1695, consequently it
cannot be the work of the elder Frans; nor can
it have been done by his grandson, the younger
Frans, who was then only six years of age. A
solution of the difficulty seems to be afforded by
a comparison of the “Travels” and the “History”
of the Baron. In the former, a journal written
at the time, he states that he was instructed in
art at Leyden, by “Miris,” but in the latter,
compiled from the former many years afterwards,
he states that “Francis Miers, a very great
painter,” was his teacher, the Christian name
being apparently added from memory, which, in
the present case, seems to have played him false.
There can be little doubt that the portrait was
drawn by Willem Van Mieris, who at the time
of Clerk’s residence at Leyden was forty-one
years of age, and in full practice as an artist. As
corroborating this supposition, we may notice
that in the account of the Clerks of Penicuik<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">{29}</span>
contributed by Miss Isabella Clerk to the “Life
of Professor James Clerk Maxwell,” and “chiefly
derived from a book of autograph letters which
was long kept at Glenlair, and is now in the
possession of Mrs. Maxwell,” it is stated that the
Baron was a pupil of <i>William</i> Mieris in drawing;
and further, that a drawing of two men’s heads
similar in style to the present portrait, preserved
in the Penicuik Drawing-room, is inscribed in the
Baron’s hand, “Originall by William Van Miris,
1696,” indicating that about the date he must
have been in communication with this artist.</p>

<p>Three oil portraits, showing the Baron in later
life, hang in the Dining-room. In the first, by Sir
John Medina, he appears still as a young man,
seen to the waist, clad in a bright blue coat and
a crimson cloak—a combination of primary
colours in which the painter frequently indulged.
His right hand is laid on a book, which rests on
an unseen table in front to the right. He wears
a long yellowish wig, with powdered curls, and
the blue eyes and the alert mouth are full of
activity and energy. Probably this portrait was
executed at the time of his marriage, in 1700, for
there is a companion picture of his first wife,
Margaret Stewart, daughter of the third Earl of
Galloway, and grand-daughter of James, Earl of
Queensberry, painted by Aikman. As was to
be expected in so early a work of the artist’s—he
must have been under twenty when he painted
it, for the lady died in 1701—this latter is full of
faults, stiff in pose, with little suggestion of the
figure under the draperies of white and blue: still
it conveys the idea of a charming and attractive
personality, fitting as that of the lady for whom
the Baron—as shown in the “History of his Life,”—mourned
so truly.</p>

<p>There is a second bust-portrait of the Baron by
Sir John Medina, a low-toned picture, executed
with care if with considerable hardness. Here the
costume is a lilac gown, with a long curled wig,
and a white cravat; the body seen turned to the
right, and the face in three-quarters to the left.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">{30}</span></p>

<p>The finest, however, of the portraits of the
second Baronet, is the three-quarters length by his
cousin, William Aikman. Here he appears robed
in his black gown as Baron of the Exchequer,
worn over a yellow-brown coat. Long white
hanging bands appear at the breast, and lace
ruffles at the wrists; and the grave face, with its
strongly marked features, is surmounted by a
long curled wig. His left hand hangs down in
front fingering among the folds of his gown, and
the right rests upon a red-covered table. The
whole is relieved against a plain brown background,
with a low-toned space of crimson curtain
to the left. It is an excellent example by the
painter, well arranged, dignified, firmly handled,
and manifestly faithful to the personality portrayed.
A bust-portrait similar in costume and
wig to this one, but with some difference in the
features, was engraved, in line, by D. Lizars,
“from a portrait in the possession of John Clerk
of Eldin, Esq.”</p>

<p>Of Sir James, the third Baronet, the architect
of the present house of Penicuik, we, unfortunately
find no adequate portrait. The only effigy of him
that is here preserved is a small silhouette in
white paper, relieved against a black background,
marked as cut two years after his death by
Barbara Clerk, his fifth sister, and as being
considered very like by those who knew him. It
shows a small face, looking a little downwards,
with a high forehead, beneath the wig, impending
over the delicate features. (<i>See</i> <a href="#Page_69">Note</a> at page 69.)</p>

<p>In the Dining-room there hangs another picture
by Aikman, marked in the Baron’s writing, “My
eldest son, John Clerk, by Lady Margaret
Stuart, born 1701, died 1722, painted by Mr.
Aikman.” The figure is seen nearly to the waist;
the costume, a long curled grey wig, and a lilac-grey
gown, lined with blue. The small eyes are
of a blue colour; the face pale, refined, and delicate-looking.
This was “the most accomplish’d Son,”
of “bright aspiring mind,” whose birth cost the
life of the Baron’s first wife, and whose own<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">{31}</span>
death, some twenty-one years later, was mourned
by Ramsay in the verses addressed to the bereaved
father, which may be read in his works. On
another wall hang three pictures, portraying, in
pairs, the Baron’s six daughters by his second wife.</p>

<p>Near the portrait of his son is a half-length by
Aikman, rather hard in execution, showing a
gentleman, with face turned to the left, in a
purple-grey coat, the end of his white cravat being
thrust through one of its button-holes. This is
Dr. John Clerk, grandson of the first Baronet of
Penicuik, whose father, Robert Clerk, was a
physician in Edinburgh, and a close friend of Dr.
Pitcairn. The son, born 1689, died 1757, was a
personage of greater mark. For above thirty
years he was the most eminent physician in
Scotland; on the institution of the Philosophical
Society of Edinburgh in 1739, he was elected a
Vice-President, an office which he held till
his death; and from 1740 to 1744, he was
President of the Royal College of Physicians,
in whose Hall in Edinburgh another smaller
portrait of him is preserved. He purchased the
lands of Listonshiels and Spittal in Mid-Lothian,
and founded the family of the Clerks of Listonshiels.
His name appears in the list of subscribers
to the collection of Ramsay’s poems, published in
1721, and he is believed to have contributed
songs to the “Tea-table Miscellany.” The portrait
of his second son, Colonel Robert Clerk, in a red
military uniform, is also preserved in the Penicuik
Dining-room.</p>

<p>Two other works by Aikman may here be
mentioned, two drawings in red chalk upon blue
paper, which hang in a passage near the Library
door. They evince more of an ideal aim than any
other of the productions of this painter with
which we are acquainted. Evidently they are
companion works, and the female portrait is
dated 1730, the year before the artist’s death.
This shows a girl’s head in profile to the left, a
young attractive little face, with the faintest half-smile
playing round the tiny mouth, and the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">{32}</span>
short hair decorated with a chaplet of leaves, or
of leaf-like ribbons. It is a portrait of Jean
Clerk, the Baron’s third daughter, who married
James Smollet of Bonhill, one of the Commissaries
of Edinburgh.</p>

<p>The other drawing shows a male face in three-quarters
to the right, with flowing hair over the
shoulders, and a heroic expression on the high-arched
brows, the raised eyes, and the rippling
lips; the dress thrown carelessly open at the
throat. This is Patrick Clerk, the Baron’s third
son. His life-record is a brief one, as given in the
Baronage along with that of three of his brothers:
“Patrick, Henry, Matthew, and Adam, died
abroad, in the service of their country.” We
learn from the Baron’s <span class="allsmcap">MS.</span> that he died at
Carthagena in 1744.</p>


<h2>VII.</h2>

<p>We now come to consider the prime artistic
treasure in Penicuik House, the largest and finest
of the three Raeburns that hang in the dining-room,
that admirable group of Sir John Clerk,
the fifth Baronet, and his wife Rosemary (so she
signed her name) Dacre. It is an oblong picture,
showing the two life-sized figures almost to the
knees, and turned towards our right. Nearly
one-half of the picture, that to the left, is occupied
with a landscape of undulating country,
diversified by darker passages afforded by tree-masses,
with flashes of light playing over the
grass in points where it is quickened by the
radiance of the setting sun, and with still sharper
flashings which mark the course of the “classic
Esk.” To our extreme right an elm-tree raises
its great forked stem, and throws out a slenderer
branch, bearing embrowned leafage. This is
carried over the upper edge of the picture, across
nearly its whole extent, repeating, by its mass of
dark against the sky, the arm of the male figure
standing beneath, which is extended, dark against
the distant expanse of dimly-lighted landscape<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">{33}</span>
background. The sky, against which the heads
of the figures are set, is filled with the soft
mellow light of a sunset after rain, struggling
with films of fluctuating misty clouds,—a sky in
the treatment of which Raeburn has used a
portrait-painter’s licence, making it lower in tone
than would have been the case in such a natural
effect. The figure furthest to our right is that of
the lady, clad in white muslin, a dress utterly
without ornament, but “adorned the most” in
the absolute simplicity of its soft overlapping folds,
delicate and full of subtlest gradation as a pile of
faintly yellow rose-leaves. The waist is girt with
a ribbon of a more definite yellow, though this too
is subdued, taking grey tones in shadow. The light
comes from behind the figures, and the edges of
the dress, catching its brightness, are the highest
tones of the picture. The lady’s face is one of
mature comeliness and dignity, the hair brown
and slightly powdered, the light touching and
outlining sharply the rounded contours of cheek
and chin, and the edge of the throat, which rises
from the masses of pure soft muslin—itself still
purer and more delicate in tone and texture.
Her left hand hangs down by her side, fingering
a little among the folds of the dress and compressing
its filmy fabric; and her right hand
rests on her companion’s left shoulder, its hand,
an admirable piece of draughtsmanship and foreshortening,
hanging over, loose from the wrist,
which is circled by a sharply struck band of
black ribbon. The Baronet stands by her side,
with his left arm—on whose shoulder the lady’s
hand rests—circling her waist, and his right
relieved against the background as it stretches
across the canvas, pointing, over the river, to
the mansion of Penicuik,—which is manifestly
visible to the pair in the distance, though unseen
to the spectator of the picture. He wears a soft
felt hat, broad-brimmed, low-crowned, and
Quaker-like in fashion, with an oval metal clasp
set in front in its band. His coat is low-toned
greyish yellow in its lights, and low-toned olive<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">{34}</span>
green in shadow, the vest and breeches showing
a lighter tone of the same; and a white cravat
and ruffles appear at throat and wrists. His face
is a well-conditioned face of middle life, small-mouthed,
with cheeks plumply rounded, and a
nose delicately aquiline. He stands, quietly
expectant, looking into the lady’s face, which is
gazing right onward into the background.</p>

<p>There is in this group none of the strong,
positive, insufficiently gradated colour, which is
sometimes rather distressing in Raeburn’s work.
It is far quieter and more delicate than is altogether
usual in his art, full of tenderness and
subtlety; the faces exquisitely lit by reflected
light, their half-shadows softly luminous and
delicate exceedingly, never sinking with a crash
into blackness and opacity. The artist has
seldom produced a finer or more artistic group,
has seldom given us a more fascinating portrayal
of well-born manhood and of female loveliness.</p>

<p>It is not at all in originality of general conception
that the greatness of Raeburn’s portraiture
usually lies, in the novel groupings of its figures,
or in any suggestion of story in their combinations.
Some other painters have contrived to
throw a hint of narrative into works which, in
first and main aim, were mere likenesses; but
Raeburn was a portraitist in the strictest and
most exclusive sense; and he simply adopted the
accepted poses of the figure that were current in
the Scottish portraiture of his day, though to
these his original genius gave a finer grace, catching
from Nature an added ease. But in the
grouping of this picture, and in its lighting—so
abnormal in arrangement—we certainly have as
definite a departure as could well be imagined,
from the stock traditions that have guided the art
of portraiture from time immemorial; and some
other reason than a purely technical one is
suggested by the marked originality of the work,
in both conception and treatment. Was this
strange and most unusual distribution of light in
the picture a mere artistic experiment in chiaroscuro?<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">{35}</span>
Did the painter devote half of his canvas to
an extended landscape vista, merely in honour of
the Baronet’s ancestral acres; and was that pose
of regardant countenance and interlacing arms
selected only because it made for a graceful flow
of changeful line? Hardly was all this the case,
one fancies.</p>

<p>May it not, then, be conceivable that when the
portrait had been commissioned, and while its
details and way of treatment were being discussed
by the pair—painter and baronet—as they sat
together, in quiet after-dinner hour over their
wine, in this very room where the completed
picture now holds its place,—is it not just conceivable
that Sir John, in some such time of genial
heart-expansion, as he poised his glass to catch
the last warm gleam of summer evening light
that streamed across the darkening woods,—that
the childless man, beginning now to verge gently
towards age, may have been stirred by ancient
memories, and have told the artist of some bygone
scene to which these ancestral woods were once
the witness? Is it a walk of plighted lovers that
the painter hints at on his canvas, and has the
bride just caught first sight of her future home?
Or, can the scene be one tenderer still? The
middle-aged lover looks—calmly, earnestly expectant,
waiting for an answer that will not come from
the lady’s lips, that will certainly not be given by
their <i>words</i>—at the noble face of the mature and
stately beauty by his side, into her dear grey eyes
that never meet his, but gaze right on into the
distance—into the future is it? Has the painter
then meant to show us one of those strenuous,
delicately-poised moments that come in mortal
lives, when “words are mere mistake,” when</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent20">“A lip’s mere tremble,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Looks half hesitation, cheeks just change of colour,”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>at once crystallise intensest emotion and afford its
fullest expression, and sign and seal a human soul
with final impress of success or failure? Is—in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">{36}</span>
briefest English—the man waiting for the sign
that will make him accepted or rejected lover?</p>

<p>This portrait, the chief treasure of Penicuik
House, would surely possess enough of interest
from the power of its artistry, and the romantic
associations with which our fancy may possibly
invest it; but its interest is deepened, and it
gathers a yet more intimate charm when we have
heard the beautiful old-world story connected
with the lady’s birth.</p>

<p>Of this curious episode there are varying
versions extant, which are given and fully discussed
by Ellen K. Goodwin, in a pamphlet
(Kendal, 1886) reprinted from the “Transactions
of the Cumberland and Westmoreland Antiquarian
and Archæological Society.” There is a
puzzling difference between the date of 15th
November 1745, given by Lady Clerk as the day
of her birth, and that of 3d November which
appears in the register of Kirkliston parish as the
day of her baptism; but this discrepancy—we
may suggest—would be lessened to within a single
day, if her Ladyship has calculated according to
New Style, introduced in Scotland in 1600, and
the register has estimated by Old Style, current in
England till 1752; while the presence of the
Highlanders at Carlisle at the time would be
accounted for if they crossed the border on “the
7th or 8th of November,” New Style.</p>

<p>The following is the interesting version of the
story, communicated by Lady Clerk herself to the
Editor of “Blackwood’s Magazine”:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“... The incident occurred November 15th,
1745. My father, Mr. Dacre, then an officer of His
Majesty’s Militia, was a prisoner in the Castle of
Carlisle, at that time in the hands of Prince
Charles. My mother (a daughter of Sir George
le Fleming, Bart., Bishop of Carlisle) was living at
Rose Castle, six miles from Carlisle, when she was
delivered of me. She had given orders that I
should immediately be privately baptized by the
Bishop’s chaplain (his Lordship not being at home)<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">{37}</span>
by name of Rosemary Dacre. At that moment
a company of Highlanders approached headed by
a Captain Macdonald, who having heard there
was much plate and valuables in the Castle came
to plunder it. Upon the approach of the Highlanders,
an old grey-headed servant ran out and
entreated Captain Macdonald not to proceed, as
any noise or alarm might cause the death of both
lady and child. The Captain enquired where the
lady had been confined. ‘Within this house,’ the
servant answered. Captain Macdonald stopped.
The servant added, ‘They are just going to christen
the infant.’ Macdonald, taking off his cockade,
said, ‘Let her be christened with this cockade in
her cap, it will be her protection now and after
if any of our stragglers should come this way:
we will wait the ceremony in silence,’ which
they accordingly did, and they went into the
coachyard, and were regaled with beef, cheese,
and ale, then went off without the smallest disturbance.
My white cockade was safely preserved
and shown me from time to time, always
reminding me to respect the Scotch, and Highlanders
in particular. I think I have obeyed the
injunction by spending my life in Scotland, and
also by hoping to die there.</p>

<p class="right"><span class="smcap">Rosemary Clerk.</span></p>

<p class="center">.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.</p>
<p>“<i><span class="smcap">Edinburgh</span>, April 21, 1817.</i>”
</p></div>

<p>In memory of the event, Lady Clerk always
wore the cockade, along with a white rose, upon
her birthday. It has been said that she presented
it to George <span class="allsmcap">IV.</span> on the occasion of his visit to
Scotland, and its existence, unfortunately, cannot
now be traced: but a still living connection of the
family informs us that she had seen the relic in
the possession of Lady Clerk, at a more recent
date than that of the royal progress.</p>

<p>It will be remembered that Scott, to whom
in his youth Sir John and Lady Clerk had been
kind, with his keen and appreciative eye for the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">{38}</span>
picturesque, has seized upon this incident and
turned it to excellent account in the opening
chapter of “The Monastery.”</p>

<p>That white cockade, the symbol of a cause so
full of poetry and romance, seems to have brought
a benison with it to the babe Rosemary Dacre,
to have dowered her with beauty, and gifted her
with an unusually magnetic attractiveness. As
she grew into fairest womanhood she had many
lovers, declared and undeclared, and in the hearts
of those who failed to win the lady her memory
seems to have lingered tenderly with no touch of
bitterness; to have been, to some of them, a
kind of lifelong inspiration, evoking gentle wistful
feelings, such as Dante Rossetti has so exquisitely
recorded in one of the finest of his
earlier poems, his “First Love Remembered.”</p>

<p>Some curious records, some strange hints of
the potent part which the lady of the white
cockade, and the memory of her, played in the
lives of certain men whom she never wedded
are preserved at Penicuik, casketed in the dainty
little Chippendale workbox that once was hers,
among other personal relics,—her long black
gloves, with a space of black lace inlet from palm
to top; her cap edged with delicate lace; a long
tress of her dark brown hair, marked “June
the 6th, 1794, aged 48”; and her silhouette, cut
in black paper, showing a strong dignified profile,
beneath a tall hat, wound round with a veil.</p>

<p>Two of the interesting letters preserved in this
quaint old workbox are from Lord Chancellor
Eldon, who in his youth, as they clearly indicate,
had been a lover of Rosemary Dacre; though
the impression can hardly have been overwhelmingly
deep or very permanent, for he
was only twenty-one when he eloped with Bessy
Surtees, a step which entailed the loss of his
Oxford fellowship, closed his hopes of preferment
in the Church, and obliged him with “a most
kind Providence for my guide,” as he says, to
take to the study of law, one of his earliest legal
efforts being the delivery, as Deputy-Vinerian<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">{39}</span>
Professor for Sir Robert Chambers, of a lecture
on “the statute of young men running away with
maidens.” But in his youth the future Lord
Chancellor was, as he used to confess, “very
susceptible.” “Oh,” he would say, “these were
happy days; we were always in love then.”</p>

<p>The first letter of the old man of nearly eighty
runs as follows:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="right">
“<i>14 April 1829.</i>
</p>

<p>“<span class="smcap">Dear Mary Dacre</span>,—Pardon my use of a
name, which belonged to you when I first knew
you. I can sincerely assure you that I have often,
often thought of the person who bore that name
when I knew her, with, may I say, sentiments of
most sincere affection? If I had been Lord
Stowell, her name now might neither have been
Molly Dacre, nor Mary, Lady Clarke.</p>

<p>“Thank you a thousand Times, thank you for
your Letter, which I have this moment received.
I would thank you more at large if I could delay
in an hour, in which I am much engaged, to thank
you, but that I cannot persuade myself to do.</p>

<p>“I have done my best to defeat this disastrous
measure. If I am wrong God forgive me! if I
am right God forgive others, if He can! Lady
Eldon, Bessy Surtees, sends her Love to you with
that of,</p>

<p>
<span class="ml4">Yr obliged and affectionate Friend,</span><br />
<span class="smcap ml12">Eldon.</span><br />
<br />
Mary Lady Clarke,<br />
<span class="ml2">100 Princess Street,</span><br />
<span class="ml4">Edinburgh.”</span><br />
</p>
</div>

<p>The second letter is written, on the 29th of
June in the same year “as Lady Eldon’s Secretary”
to thank Lady Clerk for a present of
jewellery.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“... After the Lapse of so many years to be
remembered by one whom we remember, I can
most sincerely say, with Respect and affection, is
perhaps the most gratifying circumstance that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">{40}</span>
could have happened to either of us. I feel the
Value of your kindness to her ten thousand Times
more than any that could have been shown to
myself. She will wear the Ornaments from you
and the Grampians as in Truth the most valuable
she has, as long as she lives, and we shall both
take some Pains to secure its being, in the possession
of those who follow after us, an heir
Loom. I know not why we search the World
over for Diamonds, when the Grampians can
furnish what equals, if it does not surpass them,
in beauty and brilliancy.</p>

<p>“How often have Lady Eldon and I—distant as
we are from your Habitation—fancied that we
have been looking at Molly Dacre, and listening
to ‘Auld Robin Gray’ sung exquisitely by her?
eyes and ears alike highly gratified. Excuse this—remember
that it comes from one, who, in his
last Letter, expressed a wish that he had been
<span class="smcap">The Elder Brother</span>.</p>

<p>“With Lady E’s Thanks and affectionate
Regards,</p>

<p>
<span class="ml6">Yr</span><br />
<span class="ml8">Dear Madam,</span><br />
<span class="ml10">Eldon.</span><br />
<span class="smcap ml12">Eliz: Eldon.”</span><br />
</p>
</div>

<p>The allusion at the close of the first letter is to
the Catholic Relief Bill which Lord Eldon so
strenuously opposed. Only four days before the
date of the note his name had headed the protest
of the Peers against the measure.</p>

<p>The Lord Stowell referred to is the Chancellor’s
elder brother, Judge of the High Court of
Admiralty. He was born in the same year as
Mary Dacre, and, curiously enough, his birth
also was associated with the presence of the
Pretender’s army. As in the other case there
are varying versions of the story. One tradition
asserts that the town of Newcastle being fortified
and closed in anticipation of the approach of
the Jacobites, who were then in possession of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">{41}</span>
Edinburgh, it was thought that his mother
should be removed to a quieter place, in
anticipation of her confinement; and that this
was effected by her being lowered in a large
basket into a boat in the river and conveyed to
Heworth, a village four miles distant. The other
version assigns the perilous descent to Dr. Hallowel,
her medical attendant, who was let down
from the top of the town wall of Newcastle in
order to be present at Heworth at the critical
moment.</p>

<p>The remaining letters afford even a more
curious glimpse of the fascination which Rosemary
Dacre exercised upon those who came within the
circle of her influence. The first is addressed to
her husband’s nephew and successor the Right
Hon. Sir George Clerk, and is dated—</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="right">
“<span class="smcap">Chitton Lodge</span>,<br />
<i>3 June 1830.</i><br />
</p>

<p>“<span class="smcap">My dear Sir George</span>,—Enclosed I send you
Capt. Morris’s verses which I mentioned to you.
The circumstances which occasioned them were
the following. Lord Stowell, Lord Sidmouth,
and Capt. Morris, with some other Friends, were
dining with me last Spring, when Lord Stowell
remarked that although Capt. Morris was the
same age as himself he was much more active and
elastic. Capt. Morris attributed this to his
having been ardently in Love for the whole of his
Life; and on being pressed to disclose the object
of his passion confessed that it was Lady Clarke,
who at the age of sixteen won his affection, and
that although he had been since married she had
never ceased to exercise an influence on his heart,
and be a source of animation. Lord Stowell
immediately acknowledged that by a remarkable
coincidence he also had been enamoured of Lady
Clarke, and at the same age of sixteen, and that
although twice married, the recollection of her
charms had not been effaced from his mind. This
of course gave rise to much mirth among the
company, Lord Sidmouth particularly laughing at<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">{42}</span>
the Lovers, who at the age of eighty-four declared
that their passion was undiminished towards a
Lady who had attained the same age,</p>

<p>
<span class="ml2">I am,</span><br />
<span class="ml4">My dear Sir George,</span><br />
<span class="ml6">Yours truly,</span><br />
<span class="smcap ml8">John Pearse.”</span><br />
</p>
</div>

<p>Then follows a copy of the enclosure from
Captain Morris of the Life Guards, who, it may
be remarked, was a well-known politician and
popular song-writer, and a boon companion of the
wits at Brooks. His portrait, engraved by Greatbach,
is given in an early volume of “Bentley’s
Miscellany,” and another portrait, painted by
James Lonsdale, was recently acquired by the
National Portrait Gallery, London.</p>

<p class="right">

<p><span class="smcap">My dear Sir</span>,—Looking in my Scrap Book
to-day, I find a few Stanzas, on my <i>deathless
Passion</i> for my <i>first love</i>, written in my latter
days, and as such an extraordinary and singular
coincidence on that subject occurred at your
table on Wednesday, I take the liberty of enclosing
them to you, the more so as Lady Sidmouth
is a correspondent, and perhaps might have no
objection to honour them with a perusal; if you
think so, and will let her Ladyship see them, I
beg permission to commit them to your care, and
I remain,</p>

<p>

<span class="ml2">Most gratefully and faithfully</span><br />
<span class="ml8">Yours,</span><br />
<span class="smcap ml10">Chas. Morris.”</span><br />
</p>

<p>“I beg leave to add that it is sixty-eight years
since I lived in Carlisle with my Father and
mother. Lady Clark will of course have no recollection
of my <i>Boyish adoration</i>, but to recall it,
if possible, to her memory, I would wish her to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">{43}</span>
know that it is Chas. Morris, son of Col. Morris,
of the 17th Regt., who lived with my mother at
Carlisle, and with whom Lady Clark and the Dacre
Family were acquainted.”</p>
</div>

<p>Then follows the brave old jingle of rhyme
which the ever-faithful lover had made in praise
of his lady:—</p>

<p>Surely it was with true significance that Rosemary
Dacre’s seal—the seal which always descends
to her name-child in the house of Penicuik—was
engraved with the sign of a single star, shedding
a benign and steadfast light over a pathless vastitude
of air and a fluctuating waste of sea; for the
Lady’s memory seems to have shone with an ideal
light through many human lives.</p>


<h2>VIII.</h2>

<p>The next portrait by Raeburn represents John
Clerk of Eldin, the seventh son of Baron Clerk,
second Baronet of Penicuik, and author of the
celebrated “Enquiry into Naval Tactics.” He
was educated at the Grammar School of Dalkeith
and the University of Edinburgh, and in that city
he engaged in business as a merchant till about
1772, when he purchased the property of Eldin,
in the parish of Lasswade, and obtained a post in
connection with the Exchequer, the secretaryship
to the Commissioners on the Annexed Estates in
Scotland. He was a man of a vigorous and active
mind, and seems to have possessed equal aptitudes
for art and science. Some of his sketches are
dated as early as 1758, but it was in 1770 that he
began to etch upon copper, and in the next
twelve years he produced a series of over a hundred
plates. These are founded upon a careful
study of the old Dutch masters of the art. In their
topographical aspect they are of great interest as
portraying many ancient buildings which have
since been removed or altered; and as examples of
etching, in spite of certain amateurish defects, they
form a curious connecting-link between the period
of Rembrandt and the early days of our own century,
when the process was taken up and carried
to such fine artistic issues by two other Scotsmen,
Geddes and Wilkie. A large collection of Mr.
Clerk’s etchings and drawings is preserved in the
Library at Penicuik. A series of the former, tinted
by Robert Adam, the celebrated architect, whose
sister, Susannah, Mr. Clerk had married in 1753,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">{45}</span>
was presented to George <span class="allsmcap">III.</span> in 1786, at the suggestion
of the Earl of Buchan. Twenty-eight of
them were issued to members of the Bannatyne
Club in 1825, and other of the coppers having been
recovered, a series of fifty-five etchings and reproductions
of sketches were issued to the same Club in
1855 with an admirable memoir by David Laing.</p>

<p>In his scientific pursuits Clerk was the intimate
associate of Dr. James Hutton, whose geological
papers his pencil was ever ready to illustrate,
and it is believed that the Professor’s “Theory of
the Earth” owed something to his friend’s suggestions.
The first part of Clerk’s celebrated “Enquiry
into Naval Tactics” was published in 1782,
and the second, third, and fourth parts were added
in 1797. Though a work of great interest and
value, the assertion that it was the means of
Rodney’s adopting that mode of breaking the
enemy’s line which led to the celebrated victory
off Dominique on 12th April 1782, seems to be one
incapable of absolute proof. We have a pleasant
characterisation of him, <i>à propos</i> of his death,
May 1812, in Lord Cockburn’s “Memorials”:—</p>

<p>“An interesting and delightful old man; full
of the peculiarities that distinguished the whole
family—talent, caprice, obstinacy, worth, kindliness,
and oddity, ... he was looked up to with
deference by all the philosophers of his day, who
were in the habit of constantly receiving hints
and views from him, which they deemed of great
value. He was a striking-looking old gentleman,
with his grizzly hair, vigorous features, and Scotch
speech. It would be difficult to say whether jokes
or disputation pleased him most.”</p>

<p>“A striking-looking old gentleman” he certainly
shows in Raeburn’s portrait—which, technically,
is an excellent example of the ‘square touch’ and
vigorous modelling of that painter—with the strong
face, clear light yellowish eyes, broad forehead,
and white hair, rising from the high-collared old-fashioned
coat. The picture has been lithographed
by A. Hahnisch in the 1855 Bannatyne Club issue
of the etchings, and the personality of its subject<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">{46}</span>
may be gathered from two other portraits;—a
crayon likeness by Skirving, showing less of
dignity and more of shrewdness, which passed by
bequest to the Blair Adam family, and was
admirably mezzotinted by S. W. Reynolds in
1800; and a three-quarters length portrait in
oils by James Saxon, now in the Scottish
National Portrait Gallery, where he is represented
seated at a table holding a plan which
depicts his naval manœuvre of breaking the
line. The latter belonged to the father of W. H.
Carpenter of the British Museum, who caused
the ships in the distance to be painted in by
William Anderson.</p>

<p>The remaining example of Raeburn at Penicuik
House is a portrait of Mr. Clerk’s eldest
son, John Clerk, Lord Eldin. Lord Cockburn
tells a pretty story of the relation between the
two. “‘I remember,’ the father used to say, ‘the
time when people seeing John limping on the
street, used to ask what lame lad that was; and
the answer would be, That’s the son of Clerk of
Eldin. But now, when I myself am passing, I
hear them saying, What auld grey-headed man
is that? And the answer is, That’s the father
of John Clerk.’ He was much prouder of the
last mark than the first.”</p>

<p>From his earliest years the future judge possessed
all that love for art which has been constant
in the family of Clerk; his own drawings possess
considerable vigour and character. He was an
enthusiastic collector, and the crowd that was
gathered in his house in Picardy Place, Edinburgh,
at the sale of his collection after his death
in 1832 was so excessive that the floor gave way,
causing the death of one person, and the serious
injury of several others. Vigorous and lifelike
sketches of his vehemence and wit and curiously
eccentric and powerful personality will be found
in the pages of Lord Cockburn and in “Peter’s
Letters to his Kinsfolk.” From their student
days Raeburn and he were chosen friends, and it
must have been about the date of the present<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">{47}</span>
portrait that the whimsical episode occurred
which Allan Cunningham records in his account
of the painter, an account that has left little
to be gleaned by later biographers. “Raeburn
received an invitation to dine with Clerk, and
hastening to his lodgings, he found the landlady
spreading a cloth on the table, and setting down
two dishes, one containing three herrings and the
other three potatoes. ‘And is this all?’ said
John. ‘All,’ said the landlady. ‘All! Did I
not tell ye, woman,’ he exclaimed, ‘that a gentleman
was to dine with me, and that ye were to get
six herrings and six potatoes?’ The tables of
both were better furnished before the lapse of
many years; and they loved, it is said, when the
wine was flowing, to recall those early days, when
hope was high and the spirit unrebuked by intercourse
with the world.”</p>

<p>The present portrait shows Clerk in the character
of a budding barrister. The figure is life-sized,
seated, seen in three-quarters to the left, the
wigged head turned nearly in pure profile to the
left. The figure, clad in black coat, black satin
vest, and knee-breeches of the same, and with
ruffs at breast and wrists, lies back easily in the
chair, the right hand extending over its arm, and
holding a law paper, the left placed, with outspread
fingers, on the table in front, which is
covered with a richly tinted cloth, on which lie
“Stair’s Institutes,” the “Regiam Magista,” and
other volumes in “law-calf,” while on the other
side, as though to hint at the advocate’s artistic
tastes, appears a cast of a classical head, just as in
the later Raeburn portrait a little bronze version
of the Crouching Venus nestles among the bundles
of briefs. The face, wearing an expression of
great earnestness and intentness, is as yet beardless,
unformed, and rather heavy-looking; different
indeed from the emphatic furrowed countenance
that appears in the later portraits which show him
when age had developed his full individuality.
The eyes are pale bluish grey, and the eyebrows
very light in colour.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">{48}</span></p>

<p>There are no other early portraits of Lord Eldin,
by which we can judge of his appearance at the
time that this one was executed. The admirable
three-quarter seated portrait by Raeburn, where
he appears holding his spectacles in his right
hand, and with the other supporting a folio which
rests on a table, shows him in later life. It passed
by bequest to the house of Riccarton, and has
been powerfully mezzotinted by Charles Turner,
the plate appearing, after it had been reduced
in size, in the Bannatyne volume of Mr. Clerk’s
Etchings, 1855. A somewhat similarly arranged
portrait, of cabinet size, painted by Andrew
Geddes, another of Lord Eldin’s artistic friends,
was in the possession of the late Mr. James
Gibson Craig; and there is the lithograph by
B. W. Crombie, a bust-portrait, in ordinary dress,
executed in June 1837, showing in the shrewd
profile face much of that “thoroughbred shaggy
terrier” aspect upon which Lord Cockburn remarks
in his “Life of Jeffrey”; and also the bust
by Joseph, engraved in line by Robert Bell, of
which a cast is in the Scottish National Portrait
Gallery.</p>

<p>In addition to these there are several caricatures
which doubtless preserve much that was
characteristic of the man. There is the etching
by Kay, in the plate of “Twelve Advocates who
Plead with Wigs on,” showing an eager countenance,
with opened mouth and protruding under
lip; and the four very vivid and lifelike sketches
by Robert Scott Moncrieff, reproduced in “The
Scottish Bar Fifty Years Ago.” The first of these
latter shows him in suppressed—but most belligerent—mood
seated as an advocate listening to
the pleadings of the council on the opposite side,
with mouth compressed, and lips drawn down at
the ends, his left hand grasping his spectacle-case,
the other cast over the arm of his chair and
grasping his papers. Another shows him pacing
the floor of the Parliament House, briefs in hand,
his gown trailing behind him, his wig perched
knowingly in front, his spectacles pushed far up<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">{49}</span>
his forehead,—much as Carlyle, in his “Reminiscences,”
records that he saw him, when he visited
the Parliament House in 1809, on his arrival in
Edinburgh to begin his student-life. “The only
figure I distinctly recollect, and got printed on
my brain that night, was John Clerk, then veritably
hitching about, whose grim, strong countenance,
with its black far-projecting brows and look
of great sagacity, fixed him in my memory.”
The third of Mr. Moncrieff’s drawings shows him
in the full fury of his vehement eloquence as a
pleader, his gown flying about him in mighty
folds, his right fist clenched and raised in excited
action. A fourth sketch, a rather terrible one,
depicts him in latest age, seated on the bench,
his hands laid in front and muffled in his judge’s
gown, his great mouth with its prominent under
lip firmly set, and his small eyes keenly observant
through his spectacles. One other caricature remains
to be noticed, the little etching marked
“X. Y. Z.,” which is often to be found bound up
along with copies of his sale catalogue, showing
him in full-length ascending a flight of stairs,
snuffbox in hand.</p>

<p>In the Business-room there hangs a small
portrait of Lord Eldin’s younger brother, William
Clerk, advocate—“only less witty and odd than
his great Swiftian brother,” as Dr. John Brown
has truly remarked—who figures so prominently
in the biography and correspondence of Sir Walter
Scott. At college they were contemporaries and
bosom friends, they passed their Civil Law and
their Scots Law examinations on the same day,
and together assumed the advocate’s gown. It
was in his company that the young Scott, after
a fishing expedition to Howgate, visited Penicuik
House, when he “was overwhelmed with kindness
by the late Sir John Clerk and his lady”—the
pair who figure in the great Raeburn group, and
when “the pleasure of looking at fine pictures,
the beauty of the place, and the flattering hospitality
of the owners drowned the recollection of
home for a day or two.” The friendship thus<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">{50}</span>
begun was continued through life; and in his
latest years Scott dwells, in his Diary, with especial
gusto upon the snug little dinners in Rose Court,
Edinburgh, when a few chosen spirits gathered
round Clerk’s bachelor board.</p>

<p>The present picture, a cabinet-sized bust, is
somewhat amateurish in its execution, but still
full of character and individuality; the features
of the shrewd, wrinkled face, its definitely curved
nose, sharply-cut mouth, thin compressed lips,
and dark, brilliantly blue eyes beneath the bushy
white eyebrows, combine into what is doubtless
a faithful rendering of that friend of whom Scott
wrote in his Diary, in 1825, “I have known him
intimately since our college days; and to my
thinking I never met a man of greater powers or
more complete information on all desirable subjects.”
It is the work of Mrs. Hugh Blackburn, a
lady so well known for her excellent renderings
of birds and animals; but another oil-portrait of
William Clerk, a cabinet-sized bust, turned to
the right and dated 1843, the work of Miss
Isabella Clerk, sister of the seventh Baronet, is
also preserved at Penicuik.</p>

<p>Among the portraits of more recent members
of the Clerk family are various works representing
their eminent politician and statistical authority,
the Right Hon. Sir George Clerk, D.C.L., the sixth
Baronet, who repeatedly represented the county
of Mid-Lothian in Parliament; who was a Lord of
the Admiralty under the Liverpool Administration;
succeeded Mr. Gladstone as Master of the
Mint in 1845, and in the same year was appointed
Vice-President of the Board of Trade, and a
member of the Privy Council. Several miniatures
representing him are preserved in the Drawing-room,
and there are also two life-sized three-quarter-length
portraits in oil. That hung in the
smaller Drawing-room is an excellent example by
William Dyce, R.A., a distant connection of the
family’s, and was painted in 1830. It is executed
with great delicacy, quietude, and reticence, and
does full justice to the Baronet’s refined and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">{51}</span>
handsome face, then in its prime. This picture
has been excellently mezzotinted by Thomas
Lupton. That in the Dining-room, painted by
the vigorous hand of Sir John Watson Gordon,
portrays Sir George in later life, seated in an
easy chair, and holding one of the statistical blue-books
which his soul loved. Of his wife, Maria,
second daughter of Ewan Law of Horsted Place,
Sussex, there is also an oil portrait in the Dining-room,
showing a refined face, with a delicate
complexion, bearing the trace of suffering in the
firmly compressed yet pathetic mouth, and the
straight dark eyebrows, which are knit a little
and contracted over the pale grey wistful eyes.
The picture has a rather slight and unfinished
appearance, and is somewhat chalky in its whites.
Its painter, the late J. R. Swinton, worked comparatively
little in oils, and examples of his better-known
crayon drawings may be studied in the
portraits of the Dowager Lady Clerk and her
sister-in-law, the Hon. Mrs. Elphinstone, which
hang in the smaller Drawing-room.</p>

<p>It should also be noticed that many characteristic
likenesses of the sixth Baronet are included
in an interesting volume of sketches, done in old
days by his niece Mrs. Hugh Blackburn, and now
preserved at Penicuik, a series portraying familiar
scenes there, and at Sir George’s London residence
in Park Street, Westminster,—card-parties and
musical evenings in which Piatti and other
eminent performers took part, days spent on the
ice, or picnicking among the Pentlands, rides in
the Park or over lonely stretches of moorland—drawings
highly humorous, plentifully touched
with caricature, yet including not a little substantial
truth of portraiture.</p>

<p>There is also in the Dining-room an interesting
cabinet-sized portrait of Sir George’s younger
brother, John Clerk Maxwell of Middleby, that
genial, practical, individual Scotsman of whom
a most interesting account is given in the life of
his distinguished son, Professor James Clerk
Maxwell. The picture is the work of his niece,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">{52}</span>
Miss Isabella Clerk, and shows some traces of
the amateur, especially in the size and uncouthness
of the hands, but a comparison with the
engraving from the portrait by Watson Gordon,
given in the above-mentioned volume, proves it
to be a substantially faithful likeness of the good
old man.</p>


<h2>IX.</h2>

<p>We now come to glance at the portraits at
Penicuik House which do not represent members
of the Clerk family. Among the earliest of
these, hung in the Dining-room, is a three-quarter-length
seated portrait of Sir Archibald Primrose,
Lord Carrington, that ancestor of the Rosebery
family who played an important part in politics
during the Restoration period, who fought under
Montrose, was captured at Philiphaugh, and
barely escaped being executed for treason; who
was appointed Lord Clerk Register in 1660, and
Lord Justice-General in 1676, presiding, in that
office, at the trial in 1678, of Mitchell for the
attempted assassination of Archbishop Sharp;
and whose later years were spent in steady
opposition to the administration of the Duke of
Lauderdale. He is styled by Burnet “the
subtelist of all Lord Middletoun’s friends, a man
of long and great practice in affairs ...; a
dextrous man of business, he had always expedients
ready at every difficulty.” In the picture
he appears in his black, gold-laced robes as Lord
Clerk Register, his right hand resting on the arm
of his chair, the left raised, and his face seen
in three-quarters to the right, with its thin prominent
nose drooping at the point, small chin,
and lips rising towards the ends and pursed and
dimpled a little at the corners. A similar picture,
but only bust-sized, stated (Catalogue of Royal
Scottish Academy Loan Exhibition, 1863) to be
dated 1670, has been long at Dalmeny, and a
copy of it was presented by Lord Rosebery to
the Faculty of Advocates in 1883, and now hangs
in the Parliament House. His Lordship has<span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">{53}</span>
recently acquired, from the Rothes Collection,
another, a three-quarter length, version of the
picture; and we are informed that there is also a
similar-sized version in the possession of Lord
Elphinstone. A portrait of Sir Archibald Primrose
appears in Mr. A. H. Millar’s list of the portraits
at Kinnaird Castle, but we have not examined
this work, and cannot say whether it is a repetition
of the present portrait.</p>

<p>Two interesting oil pictures showing Charles, third
Duke of Queensberry, and his celebrated Duchess,
hang near the portrait of Lord Carrington. The
Duke, the correspondent of Swift, painted rather
dryly and hardly by Miss Ann Forbes, whose
work we have already referred to, is seen to
below the waist, clad in peer’s robes, the figure
turned towards the right. The face, shown in
three-quarters, closely resembles that in the
cabinet-sized bust in oils at Ballochmyle, and
in the mezzotint engraved in 1773, by Valentine
Green after George Willison, with the same high
cheek-bones, and prominent high-bridged nose,
and the eyes are of a warm brown colour; but
the face is older than in either of the other
portraits, grave and worn, and covered with
wrinkles.</p>

<p>The companion portrait of the Duchess,
“Prior’s Kitty, ever young,” the eccentric
patroness of Gay, a work by Aikman, recalls in
most of its details her portrait by Charles Jervas,
in the National Portrait Gallery, London. She
is shown in three-quarters length, slim, graceful,
and youthful, clad in a coquettish country
costume, a dress of greyish brown, of dainty
proportions at the waist, low-breasted, and with
short sleeves that display the well-turned arms,
with a small white apron, and a little close cap
set on the head and almost entirely concealing
the dark brown hair. The face, with its blue eyes
and fresh delicate complexion, is drooping a little,
turned in three-quarters to the left; her left hand
rests on the edge of a milk-pail, and her right
holds what appears to be a broad round-brimmed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">{54}</span>
hat. The background is a landscape, with rocks
and trees rising behind the lady to the left, and
with a stretch of green meadow to the right—in
which, however, no figures appear, as in the
National Portrait Gallery picture,—and a space
of blue sky faintly tinged with red towards the
horizon.</p>

<p>We are informed that these three last-named
works were acquired at a sale, about the end of
the last century.</p>

<p>Near them hangs a three-quarter-length portrait
which forms an interesting memorial of one
of the second Baronet’s most congenial friendships.
It represents that prominent statesman in
the days of Queen Anne and George <span class="allsmcap">I.</span>, Thomas,
eighth Earl of Pembroke, Lord-Lieutenant
of Ireland in 1707, a man of great refinement
and varied culture, President of the Royal
Society, of which body Baron Clerk was elected a
member in 1728, “an honour”—as he states in his
“History”—“I value much.” Clerk first made
his acquaintance during his student-days at
Leyden, when the Earl was acting as First Plenipotentiary
at the Treaty of Ryswick. In his
account of that Treaty in the “History of my Own
Times,” Bishop Burnet remarks that “there was
something in his person and manner that created
him an universal respect; for we had no man
among us whom all sides loved and honoured as
they did him.” In 1726 Clerk tells us that he
corresponded with Lord Pembroke upon classical
and antiquarian subjects; it was then that the
Earl “sent me his Picture which is now among
the Ornaments of Mavisbank,” one of Sir John’s
houses; and after he visited London in the
following year, and examined its chief artistic
collections, he records with delight his pilgrimage
to his friend’s seat of Wilton, and his appreciation
of the princely gathering of statues, coins, medals,
etc., which he had brought together there, and
especially of his great ancestral treasure, the Van
Dyck group of Earl Philip and his family. The
eighth Earl, it may be noticed, died in January<span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">{55}</span>
1732-3, not 1702-3, as given in Noble’s “Granger,”
or 1722-3, as stated by Chaloner Smith.</p>

<p>In the portrait he appears in three-quarters
length, clad in armour, with a lace cravat, and a
long dark curling wig, the jewel of the Garter
being suspended by its blue ribbon under his right
arm. The figure is turned to the left, but the
sallow, shaven face, with its dark eyes appearing
from beneath bushy black eyebrows, looks in
three-quarters to the right. His right hand is
raised holding a baton, behind which is placed a
helmet, the left rests on a gold-hilted sword;
and there is a rocky background, disclosing a
space of sky and sea with a ship and boats.</p>

<p>The picture is evidently a version of the portrait
of the Earl painted by William Wissing,
mezzotinted by John Smith in a plate to which
the date of 1709 has been assigned, though the
painting must have been executed much earlier,
as Wissing died in 1687. The naval background
is stated to be from the brush of “Vandevelde,”
having evidently been introduced by
that artist, after the death of the original
painter of the work, at the time when the
Earl was appointed Lord High Admiral of Great
Britain and Ireland, a post which he held
in 1701, and again in 1708. The younger
William Vandevelde must be the artist indicated,
as the elder painter of the same name died in
1693.</p>

<p>Among the other portraits in the Dining-room
may be mentioned a fine three-quarters length
of the Earl of Denbigh, by Lely; a vigorous bust-portrait
of the Duke of Norfolk, by Kneller,—the
eighth Duke, as is proved by the robe and collar
of the Garter which appear in the picture; and
a copy from the well-known Janssen portrait of
Drummond of Hawthornden, in the possession of
the Earl of Home: while the portraits of Prince
Charles Edward and of his wife the Princess
Stolberg, known as the Countess of Albany,
though sufficiently indifferent works of art, possess
a certain interest as having been presented to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">{56}</span>
Rosemary Clerk by Miss Law of Princes Street,
Edinburgh, after she had heard the tale of the
White Cockade, as recorded by Lady Clerk herself,
in the postscript to her letter to the Editor of
“Blackwood’s Magazine,” which we have already
quoted.</p>


<h2>X.</h2>

<p>In the Corridor hangs an important and striking
portrait of Lord Godolphin, probably from the
hand of William Aikman, a work doubtless
acquired by the Baron as representing an eminent
English statesman with whom he had been brought
into contact about the time of the Union. The
figure is seen to below the waist, turned in three-quarters
to the right; and the face is more individual
and characteristic, if less dignified and
well conditioned, than that which appears in
Houbraken’s line-engraving, or in Smith’s mezzotint
after Kneller. The nose is small and clear-cut,
the mouth has a thin upper lip drawn inwards
a little, the eyebrows are straight, slight, and of a
dark brown colour, and there are strong lines on
the cheeks curving downwards from the nostrils.
A long grey curling wig is worn, and a claret-coloured
coat, with a plain cravat falling in front;
and a ruddy cloak is wrapped round the waist,
and passed over the left arm. His right hand
rests against his side, and his left is laid gracefully
over a parapet.</p>

<p>In the same Corridor, hung over a door in an
exceedingly bad light, is a bust-portrait titled on
the back, in an old hand, “Calderwood the
Historian by Jamesone.” The costume is a small
black cap and a black doublet with a round ruff.
The face, seen in three-quarters to the right,
against a dark background, is full of intelligence;
the features small, the eyes grey, the moustache
and beard of a moderate length, yellowish-brown
in colour. The flesh-tints are ruddy, inclining,
indeed, to an unduly hot tone, but the picture
has evidently been much repainted. It is undoubtedly
a production of the period indicated in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">{57}</span>
the inscription, and resembles works that have
been attributed to Jamesone; but we are not acquainted
with any duly authenticated portrait of
the historian of the Kirk of Scotland with which
it might be compared.</p>

<p>The excellent bust-portrait in the Drawing-room,
attributed to Holbein, is certainly incorrectly
titled as representing Sir Thomas More.
This vigorous, ruddy, bearded countenance is quite
unlike the worn, shaven, student’s face which
appears in the Chancellor’s authentic portraits by
Holbein,—in his two drawings in the Royal Collection
at Windsor, and in the pen sketch, for the
lost oil picture of the Family of Sir Thomas More,
which he himself sent to his friend Erasmus, by
the hand of the painter, when Holbein returned
to the Continent in 1529, a sketch still preserved
in the Museum of Basle.</p>

<p>Again, the curious, but much injured, panel
picture in the smaller Drawing-room, of a lady
wearing a white pipe-frilled cap, with a bowed
veil over it, titled “Mary of Guise,” shows no
resemblance to such authentic portraits of the
Queen as that at Hardwick, in which she appears
with her husband King James <span class="allsmcap">V.</span>; and the
impaled lozenge on the background bears no trace
of the arms of either Lorraine or Scotland.</p>


<h2>XI.</h2>

<p>We have now to examine the mural decorations
of Penicuik House, which include the celebrated
Ossian ceiling of the room designed for a picture-gallery,
and now used as the Drawing-room. But
first, two smaller cupolas surmounting the staircases
which give access to the upper floor of the
mansion are deserving of notice. One is decorated
in upright compartments, showing Jupiter in his
car drawn by snakes, wielding his thunderbolts,
with a moonlit landscape beneath, and on the
other side a figure of Apollo, with yellow rays
circling his head, driving his team of fiery white
steeds over a landscape which is beginning to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">{58}</span>
blush beneath the rosy light of dawn. Between
these are ranged a series of allegorical figures of
the Months, each marked with a sign of the
Zodiac, and surrounded by scrolls, grotesque
birds, and beasts, and vases. The whole is relieved
against a light green background, and
the compartments are divided by broad bands
of ochre.</p>

<p>This curious example of the decorative art of
the end of the last century is the work of John
Bonnar, then a decorative painter in Edinburgh;
and when, a hundred years after its execution,
his grandson and great-grandson, who were at the
time pursuing the same business in the same city,
cleaned and restored the work, along with the
Runciman ceilings, their ancestor’s signature was
disclosed upon a corner of its surface.</p>

<p>The other cupola is decorated by the hand of
Alexander Runciman, with scenes from the life
of St. Margaret of Scotland, whose history
furnished only the other year a subject for the
brush of another of the most imaginative of our
Scottish painters, Sir Noel Paton. Curiously
enough we can find no single reference to this
important St. Margaret series in any of the
biographies of Runciman, or in the anonymous
pamphlet, published in 1773, which so elaborately
describes the ceiling of the Ossian Hall. Both
series are executed in oil colours upon the plaster.
Here the decorations consist of four oval compartments,
each occupied with a scene from the
life of the Queen.</p>

<p>The first shows “The Landing of St. Margaret.”
Its background is a rich blue sky, and a distance
of stormy sea. In the centre is King Malcolm,
clad in a broad Scottish bonnet with a little white
plume, red knee-breeches, white hose and white
shoes with ample rosettes, and with a red cloak
flapping around him in voluminous folds. With
one hand he leads the lady, robed in a yellow
mantle and a white dress, her long yellow hair
tossed by the wind, and with the other points
energetically towards the church before them,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">{59}</span>
where white-robed monks, with clasped hands,
are awaiting their arrival.</p>

<p>The second subject is “The Royal Wedding.”
The pair are being united by a venerable and
aged ecclesiastic with a grey beard, whose
bronzed, weather-beaten countenance tells splendidly
against his elaborate white vestments. To
his right is the King, crowned and robed in red,
placing the ring on the hand of the Queen, who
stands draped in gold-brocaded white and green.
An altar appears to our right, and beside it a
mail-clad knight, with head bowed in worship.
The figures of women are introduced to our left,
and white flowers and a steaming censer lie on
the ruddy marble pavement beneath.</p>

<p>The third subject shows the manner of the
saint’s queenship. She is known to her people in
the breaking of bread; clad in the same robes
that she wore at the marriage festival, she is
feeding the poor, and her husband, in his red
mantle and wearing his royal crown, follows in
attendance upon her, bearing a heaped platter.</p>

<p>The fourth subject shows the final development
of Queen Margaret’s saintship. Having on
earth filled herself with the life of heaven, she is
now seen, white-clad, and with a red robe falling
from her shoulders like the mortal life that she is
done with, ascending inevitably into skies, where
the clouds dispart to disclose the benignant figure
of the Almighty Father and the white shape of
the Holy Dove. Beneath is outspread a familiar
landscape which she is leaving for ever—the Fifeshire
hills appear on the right on the farther side
of the Firth, and beneath is the town of Edinburgh,
with the Palace, and the Castle rock crested with
her chapel, and to the left the Pentlands which
overlook Penicuik, with a kindly ray streaming
from above, and irradiating their summit.</p>

<p>In spite of all deductions that may be made on
account of occasional crudities and defects, and of
the glaring anachronisms of costume that are apt
to offend our more archæologically cultured eyes,
the series is a remarkable one, with great richness<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">{60}</span>
and variety of colouring, and with a dramatic
power which goes directly to the heart of the
legendary tale, and portrays its incidents in a
vivid and impressive manner. Dealing for the
most part with definite history, the series is more
complete in its realisation than was possible in
some of the visionary subjects from Ossian which
the painter afterwards essayed in the Hall of
Penicuik House.</p>

<p>The three last-named subjects are signed: the
second bears the date of “Sept. 7, 1772,” the
third “Octr. 14, 1772,” and the fourth “Octr.
6, 1772.” The inscriptions are interesting as
showing that the subjects were executed immediately
after the painter’s return from Italy, and
as illustrating the impetuous speed with which
he must have worked.</p>


<h2>XII.</h2>

<p>Runciman next turned to the larger undertaking
of which the St. Margaret Cupola was but
the prologue, and upon which he worked with
equal energy, for the ceiling of the Ossian Hall
of Penicuik House can hardly have been commenced
before the end of 1772, and it was
certainly completed during the following year.</p>

<p>It was just ten years previously that “Fingal”
(1762) and “Temora” (1763) first appeared, and
the controversy regarding their authenticity still
raged fiercely. Dr. Johnson and David Hume
denied their claim to be regarded as genuine
Celtic poems, but they were defended by Lord
Kames, Dr. Gregory, and by Dr. Blair, who
pointed out their adaptability to the purposes of
the painter, as presenting fitting subjects for the
exercise of his brush. It was probably upon this
suggestion that the Ossian ceiling was commissioned
by Sir James Clerk, and commenced by
Alexander Runciman.</p>

<p>The centre of the ceiling is occupied by a large
elliptical compartment, depicting Ossian old and
blind, singing, and accompanying his songs on the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">{61}</span>
harp. In front is seated the white-draped shape
of Malvina, and around are grouped a varied
crowd of listeners. The distance is a rocky coast,
with ruined castles, and a fine expanse of sea,
across which white sails are speeding; and above,
the clouds take strange, fantastic, half-defined
shapes as of spiritual presences, the figures of the
vanished heroes of whom the poet sings,—“The
awful faces of other times look from the clouds of
Crona.” This compartment is surrounded by an
ornamental border of gold, which in its turn is
enclosed in a wreath of vine-leaves and fruit;
and the four corners are occupied by figures
symbolical of the four great rivers of Scotland,
the Tay, the Spey, the Clyde, and the Tweed,—figures
manifestly reminiscent of the work of
Michael Angelo in the Sistine Chapel.</p>

<p>Beneath, round the ample cove or <i>volto</i> of the
room, is ranged a series of smaller subjects from
Ossian—“The Valour of Oscar,” “The Death of
Oscar,” “The Death of Agandecca,” “The Hunting
of Catholda,” one of the finest of the subjects,
very graceful in the figure of the nymph drawing
a bow; “The Finding of Corban Cargloss,” an
attractive moonlit scene; “Golchossa mourning
over Lamderg,” “Oina Morval serenading Ossian,”
a vigorous subject of “Cormac attacking the
Spirit of the Waters,” “The Death of Cormac,”
“Scandinavian Wizards at their Incantations,”
in which the grotesque is in excess of the terrible,
and “Fingal engaging the Spirit of Lodi.”</p>

<p>If we were to criticise the ceiling purely as an
example of decorative art, we might well object
that the elaboration and wealth of detail in the
work is hardly suitable to its position, that
designs so placed should have been simpler and
more salient in their component parts, and
executed in a lighter and more airy scheme of
colouring, so as to carry the eye freely upwards.
But as an example of poetic art, in its earnestness of
aim and vigour of conception, it is deserving of all
praise, as one of the very few instances that Scotland
has to show of a serious effort to produce a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">{62}</span>
monumental work, a pictorial epic,—an effort
honourable alike to the painter and his patron.
The art of Runciman, as here displayed, may be
regarded as the precursor of the art of David Scott,
another of Scotland’s most imaginative painters,
who was also powerfully attracted by the Ossianic
legends, choosing “Fingal and the Spirit of Lodi”
for the subject of one of his earliest works, and in
another depicting Ossian himself, not surrounded
by sympathetic listeners as in this central compartment
by Runciman, but seated alone by the sea-shore,
amid the last dying radiance of a sunset,
with his harp lying idle by his side.</p>

<p>It is recorded that about 1720 John Alexander,
the grandson of George Jamesone of Aberdeen,
executed a “Rape of Proserpina” on a staircase
in Gordon Castle. After the completion of his
work at Penicuik Runciman decorated a church
in the Cowgate of Edinburgh (now St. Patrick’s
Catholic Chapel) with sacred subjects, of which a
portion still remain; and—presumably in humble
imitation of the Ossian Hall—Alexander Carse
painted an oval subject on the ceiling of the
“Pennecuik Parlor” of New Hall, Mid-Lothian,
depicting “The Troops of Tweedale in the Forest
of Selkirkshire, convened by Royal authority in
May 1685, as described in Dr. Pennecuik’s
Poems.” This brief list may be said to include
almost all the mural art—excepting such as was
simply decorative—executed in Scotland during
modern times.</p>

<p>The Ossian ceiling formed the subject of a
learned and elaborate descriptive pamphlet, published
anonymously, in 1773, by A. Kinnaird and
W. Creech, Edinburgh; and the painter would
appear to have intended to preserve a record of
his work—in the manner afterwards adopted by
Barry, in the case of the illustrations of “Human
Progress,” with which he decorated the walls of
the Hall of the Society of Arts in London, for
etchings, executed by Runciman’s own hand in a
free and somewhat loose style, of the first two
subjects of the St. Margaret Cupola, and of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">{63}</span>
“Cormac attacking a Spirit of the Waters,” and
“The Finding of Corban Cargloss,” from the
Ossian ceiling, are frequently to be met with.</p>

<p>We have not been able to discover in Penicuik
House Alexander Runciman’s easel Picture of
“Nausicaa at Play with her Maidens,” executed
during his residence at Rome, and shown in
London, in the Free Society of Artists’ Exhibition
of 1767, a work which Allan Cunningham informs
us was “painted for Pennycuik”: and, on account
of the delicacy and transparency of its colouring,
we should be inclined to attribute to John Runciman,
who died at Naples at the early age of
twenty-four, that sketch of “David with the
Head of Goliath,” which has been commonly
assigned to the elder of the two brothers.
Certainly by John Runciman is the excellent
picture of “Belshazzar’s Feast,” hung in the
Billiard-room, a work so delicate in its handling,
so mellow in the golden and ruddy tones of its
colouring, as to support the opinion held by
some discerning critics, that this artist’s brief life
afforded definite promise of his becoming a far
subtler and more refined painter than the better-known
member of his family ever was.</p>


<h2>XIII.</h2>

<p>In the Drawing-room hang many admirable
and interesting works, to a few of which we may
direct attention. Chief among them is the noble
three-quarter-length of Anthony Triest, Bishop
of Ghent, by Rubens, a portrait most characteristic
in pose, vigorously lifelike in expression,
and accomplished in colour. Another portrait of
this prelate, a seated half-length turned to the
right, was painted by Van Dyck, Rubens’ great
pupil, and etched by his own hand in a plate
which was afterwards completed with the graver
by Peter de Jode. In the same room is Van Dyck’s
rendering of “A Lady of the Coningsby Family,”
a graceful full-length, draped in rose-colour, the
gloved right hand resting on a flower-pot which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">{64}</span>
is relieved against a wooded background, and the
right foot raised as the figure stands on a flight of
stone garden-steps. A bust-sized male portrait of
an unknown subject also bears the name of Rubens,
and, by whatever hand, it is certainly an admirable
example of Flemish art. The costume is
black with a piped ruff; the face worn, the brow
furrowed, the hair yellowish, slightly silvered with
age, the thick beard and moustache of a ruddy
colour, and the flesh-tones most attractive in the
quietude and cool grey quality of their shadows.
By Zeeman, an esteemed Dutch painter of naval
subjects, known, too, as an etcher of much
directness and simplicity of method, is a large
sea-piece, with shipping and a great expanse of
sky in which the clouds are beginning to grow
mellow towards the sunset; and by Melchior
Hondecoeter we have a vigorous picture of
“Fighting Cocks,” firmly painted, and effective
in the contrast of the white plumage of the
nearer bird to the glowing brown and ruddy
tones of the rest of the picture.</p>

<p>The Library, a particularly sunny and spacious
room on the upper floor, contains in addition to
its books—which, as we have already said, include
those bequeathed to the Baron by Boerhaave, his
early friend,—a fine and extensive collection of
prints, duly catalogued and arranged in volumes
according to their various schools. Among the
rest are some rare Dürer items, and a set of John
Clerk’s etchings in their progressive states, along
with many original sketches by his hand.</p>

<p>Over the fireplace is inlet in the wainscoting
an attractive subject representative of “Music,”
executed in <i>grisaille</i> on canvas, in clever
simulation of a marble bas-relief. It is signed
by its painter, Jacob de Wit, a native of
Amsterdam, born 1695, died 1754, who “attained
a marvellous excellence in the imitation of
sculpture of all kinds of materials, bronze, wood,
plaster, and particularly white marble, in which
he produced such complete illusion that even the
practised eye is deceived.” His most notable<span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">{65}</span>
work of this kind was the decoration, in 1736, of
a hall in the Hôtel de Ville of Amsterdam; and
it is further stated by Kugler that “a favourite
subject with the master was the representation of
pretty children in the taste of Fiammingo.” The
present picture, in the satisfying arrangement of
its composition and in the grace of its flowing
lines, possesses a more legitimate artistic value
than could come from any merely imitative
dexterity in rendering the effect of sculpture by
means of painting. The musicians are a party of
naked, chubby children. The figure of their
leader is an especially charming one, standing
holding up a music-book in one hand, beating
time with a roll of papers held as a baton in
the other, and singing with open mouth; his
raised face, with the soft hair clustering about
the rounded cheeks, wearing an entranced expression
which embodies the very spirit of
melody. Beside him one of his infant musicians
touches the wires of a lyre, another bends over
a great mandoline, of which a third is tightening
the strings, and a fourth breathes softly on the
flute.</p>

<p>At the entrance to the Library door are placed
two large glass cases, one filled with natural
history specimens, the other containing the
valuable collection of Roman remains, in metal,
pottery, coins, etc., accumulated by Baron Clerk,
which it would require the skill of an archæologist
rightly to estimate. Among them is a
curious and most interesting ivory carving,
inscribed, on a parchment label, in the Baron’s
handwriting, “An Antient piece of Sculpture on
the Tooth of a Whale,—it was found by John
Adair, Geographer, in the North of Scotland,
Anno 1682, all the figures are remarkable.” In
this year Adair, the Geographer for Scotland,
was appointed by the Privy Council of Scotland
to make a survey of the kingdom and maps of
the shires, of which only a portion was published.
The carving represents a crowned queen, seated
holding a lapdog on her knees; with a knight,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">{66}</span>
wearing a surcoat over chain-armour, and bearing
a sword and a shield blazoned with a <i>chevron
chequé</i>, standing on her left; and on her
right a musician playing on a crowde, an old instrument
resembling a violin; while between these,
round the rest of the ivory, is a row of female
figures, wearing long flowing robes, standing with
clasped hands, that beside the musician holding
a palm-branch. The carving is described and
figured in Dr. Daniel Wilson’s “Prehistoric Annals
of Scotland.” Dr. Wilson considers it to be a
queen piece of a chess set, and assigns it to the
fourteenth century.</p>


<h2>XIV.</h2>

<p>In the Charter-room are preserved, in addition
to documents, many curious miscellaneous relics
of an artistic and personal sort. The MSS.
include the account-books of the family, extending
well into the seventeenth century, kept with
the minutest accuracy, and containing many
entries of great interest to the student of the
social manners of the past. There are also
voluminous devotional compositions, commonplace-books,
etc., by the first Baronet; and the
<span class="allsmcap">MS.</span> “History of my Life,” and the two volumes
of the “Journal of my Travells for 5 years
Through Holland, Germaine, Italy, France, and
Flanders,” by the second Baronet, Baron Clerk,
along with the MSS. of several of his published
and unpublished historical and antiquarian
pamphlets.</p>

<p>A somewhat grim development of portraiture
is seen in a couple of waxen death-masks—one of
them shows the face of Lady Margaret Stuart,
the Baron’s much-loved first wife—each casketed
in its little wooden case or shrine. The habit of
preserving such masks seems to have been
common in Scotland during the seventeenth and
eighteenth centuries,—we remember that the
Abertarff sale included several representing various
members of the Lovat family: a survival, one<span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">{67}</span>
may call it, of the old Roman custom of preserving
the waxen images of ancestors, which
prevailed, too, in France, in the days when Clouet
was summoned to Rambouillet, to cast the waxen
effigy of the dead Francis <span class="allsmcap">I.</span></p>

<p>In the Charter-room are various interesting old
miniatures and drawings, among the latter one
of a cupid and a griffin, attributed to Raphael;
one by Guido; a couple of designs by Inigo
Jones—one marked “given me by the Earl of
Burlington in 1727” (the year of the Baron’s
visit to London), “I very much value this and
the other drawing by Inigo. John Clerk, 1744;”
and the original sketch for the picture of St.
Cecilia, still preserved at Penicuik, by Francesco
Imperiali, an artist of repute in his day, who died
at Rome in 1741, under whom the Baron studied
art when in Italy, and who was afterwards one of
the instructors of Allan Ramsay, the portrait-painter.</p>

<p>Another relic of the Baron’s days in Italy is
the small marble bust of Cicero—preserved in the
Charter-room—which, as he tells us in his “History,”
was bequeathed to him by “Montignia Chapigni,
a learned antiquarian and philosopher.” Yet
another is a little wooden casket, fragrant still
with a sweet old-world perfume, as we open the
drawers filled with neatly stoppered bottles. This
is the “Box of Chymical Medicines, still at Penicuik,”
which was presented to the Baron on his
leaving Florence, along with “all the variety of
wines and sweet meats which his country produced,”
by the Grand Duke Cosimo <span class="allsmcap">III.</span>, who had
previously honoured the young Scotsman by bestowing
on him “a patent under the privy seal
signed by himself and his Secretary of State, the
Marquise de Ricardi, appointing me a Gentleman
of his Bedchamber, which patent lies now in the
Charter-room.”</p>

<p>On one of the shelves is placed another curious
family relic, a basket filled with artist’s materials,
marked “Oil colours brought from Rome by Uncle
Sandy,” a son of the first Baronet, that Alexander<span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">{68}</span>
Clerk who figures in the Baronage as “bred a
painter,” and whose name appears, in 1729, on
the original indenture of the Edinburgh School
of St. Luke, as a member of that first academy
founded in Scotland for the study of art, in which,
six years later, Strange the engraver received
instruction. In this old document, so significant
in the history of painting in our country, and now
fittingly in the possession of the Royal Scottish
Academy, Richard Cooper, Strange’s master,
appears as Secretary. Among the other signatures
are those of James Clerk, Alexander’s elder
brother, afterwards third Baronet of Penicuik;
his nephew Hugh Clerk, Junr., who “served with
the allied army in Germany, and died soon after
the battle of Minden”; the two Ramsays; “Ja.
Norie” and “Jas. Norie, Junior”; John Patoun,
whose portrait of Thomson the poet is now in the
National Portrait Gallery, London; John Alexander,
the portrait-painter, who engraved the
family group of his grandfather, George Jamesone
of Aberdeen; and William Denune, known by his
portraits of Thomas and Mrs. Ruddiman, of
Professor Robert Simson of Glasgow (1746), and
of the Rev. William Harper, Episcopal clergyman
in Leith (1745).</p>

<p>There is one other of the contents of the
Charter-room to which we must refer, a volume
containing a complete set of Turner’s “Liber
Studiorum” prints, evidently an original subscriber’s
copy; most of the plates are in excellent
impressions, and some are proofs.</p>

<p>For permission to examine these, and all the
other Art Treasures at Penicuik House—to many
of which we have been unable even to refer—we
have to express our grateful thanks to Sir George
Clerk, the owner of the mansion, and to the
Dowager Lady Clerk, its present occupant.</p>

<p class="center">(<a href="#Page_30"><i>See</i> page 30.</a>)</p>

<p>We have just had an opportunity of examining
the portraits of Sir James Clerk, the third
Baronet, and Elizabeth Cleghorn, his wife, in the
possession of Miss Eliott Lockhart, at 17 Rutland
Street, Edinburgh. In each the figure is seen to
the waist, within a painted oval. The Baronet is
clad in a yellowish pink gown, worn over a red
vest, with the shirt unbuttoned at the throat.
The face, turned slightly to the right, has clear-cut
features, full blue eyes, and dark eyebrows,
the hair being entirely concealed by a blue cap.
The left hand is laid on the top of a folio volume,
resting on a table to the right, which is covered
with a brilliantly patterned cloth; and a green
curtain appears behind to the left. In the portrait
of Lady Clerk the face is seen in three-quarters
to the left, and has pale yellow hair and
eyebrows, and blue eyes. The costume is a white
dress worn low at the throat, and a blue mantle.
A tree-trunk appears behind the head, and a
wooded landscape to the right. Each picture is
signed with the name of a portrait-painter which
we have not elsewhere met with—“<i>Gul: Mosman
pingebat 1739.</i>” The handling of the works is
hard and definite.</p>

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
